 Inveting.com, Bank Borrowing From Fed Bailout Program Has Surged, 2024-01-05,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Is a U.S. banking crisis still bubbling under the surface?
If activity in the Federal Reserves bank bailout program is any indication, the answer to that question is yes.
Over the last two months, the balance in the Fed Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has surged, and the pace of borrowing appears to be increasing.
Since Nov. 19, the amount of outstanding loans in the BTFP has increased by $27.3 billion. The balance in the bailout program grew by nearly $5.4 billion in just the last week.
As of Jan. 3, the balance in the BTFP stood at just over $141.2 billion. Its the largest balance since the program was created in March.
Borrowing had leveled off in August before the sudden spike in November. Keep in mind that banks were still tapping into the bailout even as the total balance in the program plateaued. Some banks were paying off loans as others borrowed.
This surge in bank bailout borrowing may indicate more banks are struggling in this high interest rate environment, and that the financial crisis that kicked off in March is still bubbling under the surface.The BTFP program is a sweetheart deal for banks struggling to raise short-term capital.

 Inveting.com, National Debt Tops $34 Trillion but so What?, 2024-01-04,0.333333,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
On Dec. 29, the national debt slipped above $34 trillion for the first time.
On the date, the debt was $34,001,493,655,565.48, to be exact.
But so what?Despite a few alarming headlines, nobody really seems to care. In fact, NPR did a story highlighting the supposed ""benefits"" of a massive national debt.
The debt continues to increase at a dizzying pace. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5, the national debt stood at $31.46 trillion. Since that time, the Biden administration has added $2.54 trillion to the national debt.
The government is running up the debt at roughly $1 trillion every three months. It eclipsed $32 trillion on June 15 and $33 trillion on September 15.
Since the beginning of 2016, the total debt has spiked by $15 trillion. Thats an 80 percent increase.
It's hard to wrap ones head around $34 trillion. To put things into perspective, every U.S. citizen would have to write a $101,234 check to pay off the debt. Every American taxpayer is on the hook for $264,090.
Or to look at it another way, $34 trillion is more than the total economies of China, Japan, Germany, and the UK combined.
Its a Spending Problem
The Biden administration likes to blame the ballooning debt on Republican tax cuts. But while federal receipts declined last year, they shrank from decade-high levels.
In fact, the government enjoyed a revenue windfall in 2022. According to a Tax Foundation analysis of Congressional Budget Office data, federal tax collections were up 21 percent that year. Tax collections also came in at a multi-decade high of 19.6 percent as a share of GDP. But at the time, CBO analysts warned the good times wouldnt last. And they didnt. Government receipts fell by 9.3 percent in fiscal 2023.
Falling revenues are certainly an issue, but you'll find the real problems on the spending side of the ledger.
On its way to the third-largest budget deficit in U.S. history, the Biden administration spent $6.46 trillion in fiscal 2023. That was an 8.8 percent year-over-year increase in actual spending.
You might think Congress solved this problem with the spending cuts in the debt ceiling deal (aka the [misnamed]
Fiscal Responsibility Act
). But we live in an upside-down world where spending cuts mean spending still goes up.
Even if Congress and the president managed to stick to the plan (and they wont), the so-called spending cuts will not put a dent in actual total spending. That means we can expect massive deficits to continue month after month.
This isnt to let Republicans off the hook. Despite occasionally paying lip service to fiscal responsibility, the GOP also borrows, spends, and runs big budget shortfalls.
To put the deficits into some historical perspective, before the pandemic, the U.S. government had only run budget deficits of over $1 trillion four times  all by the Obama administration in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.The Trump administration almost hit the $1 trillion mark in 2019 and was on pace to run a trillion-dollar deficit in fiscal 2020 prior to the pandemic, even as the U.S. supposedly enjoyed the best economy ever. The economic catastrophe caused by the governments response to COVID-19 gave policymakers an excuse to spend with no questions asked and we saw record deficits in fiscal 2020 and 2021.
Now the Biden administration has settled into the new status quo  running 08 financial crisis-like deficits every single year.
Notably, this relentless increase in debt is happening when the economy is supposedly strong. Typically, a strong
economy
generates more tax revenue, and deficits shrink. But this isnt really a strong economy. It is a house of cards built on debt. Fiscal stimulus is helping to prop it up.So What?
One of the most common responses I get when I talk about the national debt is, So what?
After all, the national debt has been expanding precipitously for years. Nothing has happened.
At least not yet.
But this is clearly an unsustainable trajectory.
This rapid increase in the national debt is happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills.
Interest expense rose by 23 percent to $879 billion in fiscal 2023. Net interest, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, rose by 39 percent to $659 billion. Both of those numbers broke records.Looking at Novembers interest expense puts things into a little sharper perspective.
Uncle Sam spent $79.92 billion in interest expense to finance the national debt in November. That was more than national defense ($70 billion) and more than Medicare ($79 billion). The only higher spending category was Social Security.
A lot of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month, some of that super-low-interest paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates.
The weighted average interest rate on the governments $26 trillion of outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.10 percent in November. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.22 percent in November 2022.Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words, the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
The bottom line is interest payments will continue to quickly climb much higher unless rates fall.
This may be one of the reasons the Federal Reserve is so eager to cut interest rates in 2024 despite price inflation being nowhere near the 2 percent target.
If the national debt climbs to $40 trillion and interest rates remain at 5 percent, interest payments on the debt would skyrocket around $2 trillion per year. That means that even if the U.S. government balanced the budget so receipts covered all spending minus interest payments, wed still be facing a $2 trillion annual deficit.
Of course, there wont be a balanced budget. So, lets assume the federal government can maintain the current deficit level of around $1 trillion annually (minus interest expense). Even with this overly optimistic scenario, the Treasury would be running a $3 trillion annual budget deficit. (Thats the current $1 trillion deficit plus $2 trillion in interest expenses.)
And the most likely scenario is spending will continue to climb, along with the budget deficits. Theres no telling how high the annual deficits could run.This is a fiscal powder keg. All it needs is a match.

 Inveting.com, US Dollar Recovers as 2024 Kicks Off, 2024-01-03,0.666667,"As we kick off January, it's common to witness some fluctuations in the stock market, primarily driven by portfolio adjustments and profit-taking activities. Many investors and fund managers engage in realigning their portfolios at the start of the year, often opting to realize profits from the previous year. This strategy is typically aimed at deferring tax liabilities, as these gains will be taxed in the new tax year, rather than in 2023.Concurrently, we might observe a rally in the US dollar. This trend is partly influenced by these portfolio adjustments, as investors may temporarily shift towards cash or dollar-denominated assets during this period of rebalancing.
However, it's important to note that these movements are often temporary.The market is likely to stabilize or even reverse these early trends as the month progresses and investment flows normalize. Additionally, today's release of the Federal Reserve minutes will offer more insights into the central bank's latest meetings.

 Inveting.com, What Would It Take to Get a Depression?, 2023-12-27,0.222222,"By Peter St. Onge, PhD
So far this year, my base case on the economy has been that we're repeating the 1970's stagflation. With a first bout of high inflation followed by a period of rapid GDP growth that ends in a second, even worse, stagflation.
Going by the 70s, that second stagflation could go on for a long time considering the last one was only ended by a brutal series of engineered recessions that cost Jimmy Carter his job.
In other words, Washington won't make that mistake again  next time they'll just let it run.
All pretty dire, but there's actually another shoe to drop an even worse outcome that  going by commenters  a lot of people are worried about"

I think that as long as jobs data and inflation figures will not show the same picture for the economy, thats how long market can be a bit tricky and choppy on dollar pairs. From an Elliott wave perspective, I see DXY in a corrective a-b-c rally, back in wave four that can be moving into 104.50-105 resistance so technically trend is down, but we need some catalyst for the downtrend to resume.

It means Goldilocks must return from her Christmas trip to Aruba and appear this week.For December, the
ISM manufacturing
index is expected to rise to 47.1 from 46.7, while the service index falls to 52.5 from 52.7.
ADP
is expected to show 113,000 new jobs were created in December versus 103,000 in November.Finally, the official BLS job report
predicts
163,000 new jobs will have been made, down from 199,000 in November.Overall, these numbers are consistent with their prior trends and suggest no significant change in economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model indicates that the fourth quarter is growing by a 2.4% seasonally adjusted annualized rate.At least, based on the estimates, there doesnt seem to be enough to support rate cuts any time shortly. If it comes in as expected, I think that data is probably enough to turn higher the recent decline in rates and tighten financial conditions.By most standards, financial conditions have eased so much that the easing could have already substituted for rate cuts.In fact, over the last two months, the GS financial conditions index has reduced by its most ever. One could argue this could have a stimulative effect on the US economy as we move forward.On top of this, we have started to see shipping rates rising, as noted by the WCI Composite Container Freight Benchmark, which has increased from 1381 on November 30 to 1660 on December 21.It will be interesting to see if the recent increase in freight cost shows up in the ISM manufacturing Priced Paid PMI for December.There are no estimates currently, but the index was 49.9 in November. If one thing is clear, higher freight costs and easing financial conditions lead to higher prices over time.If this shows up, then I would think the recent decline in long-term rates will likely reverse; how high rates on the back of the curve go from here is unclear, but there are signs that the
10-year rate
can also go higher from a technical standpoint.The RSI is starting to consolidate and is even showing signs of turning higher. The big test will be when the 10-year reaches the 10-day exponential moving average and if it can breathe above that moving average.If the 10-year does break higher, the downtrend at 4% becomes the next target, and after that, we would be talking about a 10-year moving higher to around 4.35%.Overall, I think this will likely result in the
10/2
curve moving higher, with most of the heavy lifting coming from the back of the curve. It certainly appears like the curve is breaking out of a downtrend.As for the
S&P 500
, higher rates and steeper curves will present problems, especially if it is because we begin to start seeing the effects of easing financial conditions in this weeks data points.The S&P 500 also broke below a rising wedge pattern and is closing in on the 10-day exponential moving average, which hasnt been broken since November 2.That moving average comes at 4,745 and is around the zero gamma level.The zero gamma level is the line that separates positive from negative gamma; a break below the zero gamma level would push the index back into negative gamma and increase volatility. I still think a return to 4,100 over the next several weeks is likely.So, at this point, it seems a lot is riding on the data this week, and to keep the market moving higher, it will take the data coming in just right. Anything too hot or cold will be a big blow to the end-of-year rally.Original Post"

In the July top, the

stayed inside the engulfing candle of July 27 for three days before breaking lower. We also saw an inside day on December 7, which led to the continuation of the rally.However, the actual setup looks fairly negative from the standpoint that we had this big sell-off on Wednesday, and all the index did was retrace 61.8% of the decline thus far. Additionally, there was a big move lower into the close on Wednesday, with a gap higher this morning; those types of gaps tend to get filled quickly. Of course, it doesnt have to, but in my experience, it usually takes a day or two.Yesterday, we got the
GDP
revisions, and it was really surprising to see such large revisions coming through and revised downward, while jobless claims were also still very low. Still, the

Overall, GDP at 4.9% is still strong but down from 5.2%.More important is that the overall trend in the economic data over the past few weeks supports a pretty healthy 4Q real GDP growth rate, which supports higher rates from the back of the curve.

 Inveting.com, What Is in Store for 2024, 2024-01-05,0.666667,"This year promises to be one of the most interesting years economically, politically, and market-wise in history. We have two significant global conflicts/wars ongoing, just as President Xi of China is reiterating his promise to annex Taiwan, and Kim Jong Un of North Korea threatens to wipe the US off the map. Meanwhile, we have the most likely Republican candidate getting thrown off state ballots under the disgusting guise of trying to preserve democracy. The US is sadly in the process of becoming a banana republic. Wars and revolutions are not a tail risk. They are happening now and are likely to metastasize in 2024.With this backdrop, we have the most expensive stock market in history prior to 2020. The price-to-sales ratio is 2.62, and the total market cap of equities is 176% of GDP; both figures are near record highs and dwarf the historical averages prior to the pandemic. And the equity risk premium is zero. Meaning the earnings yield of stocks is less than that yield offered by simply owning a risk-free T-bill. In other words, investors are not getting compensated at all for the extra risk of owning stocks over bonds.We think earnings growth this year will be in the low single digits at best. However, Wall Street gurus have penned in
S&P 500
EPS growth of nearly 12% this year. But even if that growth is somehow incredibly achieved, the market has already priced in that hope. The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.3. This P/E ratio is above the 5-year average of 18.8 and above the 10-year average 17.6, according to FactSet.Therefore, economic growth must absolutely soar in 2024 to justify these valuation metrics. Or, the Fed must slash borrowing costs back towards ZIRP. But the latter scenario would only occur if the Fed was reacting to an economy that was falling apart, which cannot be good news for stocks. Yet, even in the former scenario, the Fed would not be cutting rates at all. Nevertheless, there are 3 rate cuts indicated by the Feds dot plot, and the 6 cuts are being priced in by the futures market. Therefore, even in the highly unlikely scenario of exploding GDP this year, it would probably entail rising rates instead of rate cuts, which would still provide a headwind for stocks.The overhanging problem is that the Treasury must find a buyer for $7 trillion of government debt this year alone. $5 trillion must be rolled over, and $2 trillion will be needed to fund the annual deficit. This will put tremendous pressure on the bond market no matter what.The month of March will be key time for markets. The reverse repo facility should get run down in at the end of the Q1 or the start of Q2. That easy liquidity for the already illiquid bond market will disappear. March is also the month when the BTFP is scheduled to expire. This entails the process of the Fed selling $133 billion in Treasuries and MBS that are sharply underwater back to the banks; and in exchange, the banks pay 100 cents on the dollar to the Fed, plus interest. Powell needs to end this program to stop the rampant speculation on Wall Street and to ensure inflation retreats towards the 2% target. But doing so will wreak havoc on the regional banking system. His decision on this front will be critical.The recession penciled in for last year did not materialize because of the massive fiscal spending and the bailout of the entire regional banking system; a.k.a. BTFP. However, the conditions for engendering a recession have not been resolved, they have been exacerbatedregardless of the soft-landing mantra prevalent in the MSFM. They are screaming goldilocks while in reality, the economy is more fragile today than ever.This does not guarantee a recession; but it does virtually guarantee that a booming economy is not in the bag. And that means investors should not blindly own the S&P 500 and trust in a bull market that never ends.I very well understand that the Fed and Treasury will indeed seek to bailout every hiccup in the market and the economy. However, this is old news. The government rode to the rescue in the tech bubble recession at the turn of the millennia and during the global financial crisis and real estate crash of 2008. But neither ZIRP, or QE, or TARP, or any of the alphabet soup of bailout programs served to stop the 50% + debacle in markets.These inflationary bailouts do tend to paper over the issues eventually; but not immediately. And of course, they result in more problems that turn out to be much more dire and intractable in the long run. In the vanguard of these problems is another round of asset bubbles, even more debt being incurred, and the condition of out-of-control inflation, which further eviscerates the middle class.In sharp contrast to recent history, if the Fed and Treasury were to try and truncate the recession, debt default, and reconciliation of asset prices, by another round of money printing and spending this time around, they will be doing so with the sting of record-high inflation fresh in the minds of consumers and businesses and investors. Therefore, the confidence in the worlds reserve status of USD and the US bond market could be obliterated. Meaning, what we could very well see is a condition where the economy enters a recession but long-term bond yields go up instead of down as is usually the case. Such an unprecedented and dangerous combination of higher borrowing costs in a faltering economy would result in carnage for stock valuations.Financial conditions and credit spreads remain quiescent for now. Therefore, we remain net long in our Inflation/Deflation and Economic Cycle Model. But we remain ready to sprint for the narrow exit door once the sell signal is received.My prediction and admonishment for 2024, be prepared for everything.**Michael Pento is the President and Founder of

Is a U.S. banking crisis still bubbling under the surface?
If activity in the Federal Reserves bank bailout program is any indication, the answer to that question is yes.
Over the last two months, the balance in the Fed Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has surged, and the pace of borrowing appears to be increasing.
Since Nov. 19, the amount of outstanding loans in the BTFP has increased by $27.3 billion. The balance in the bailout program grew by nearly $5.4 billion in just the last week.
As of Jan. 3, the balance in the BTFP stood at just over $141.2 billion. Its the largest balance since the program was created in March.
Borrowing had leveled off in August before the sudden spike in November. Keep in mind that banks were still tapping into the bailout even as the total balance in the program plateaued. Some banks were paying off loans as others borrowed.

 Inveting.com, The Only 2 Ways to Win in Trading, 2023-09-19,0.666667,"It doesnt matter if you are Warren Buffett holding positions for decades or Ken Griffith holding them for milliseconds - there are only two ways to trade.In trading you can either go with the price action - or in traders parlance trade flow or go against the price action or fade the move.If you are going to day trade against trend need to know three things - what to trade, when to trade and how much profit to go for.Here is a set up I trade every day in stock index futures. During the European open (around 4 am) stock futures usually make a session high or session low that is fadable for at least 20 points. And even if the trade doesnt work the first time it usually resolves in profit on the second or the third attempt.But trend! Trend is something different altogether. Trend or flow trading has a very specific tell that can give very accurate reads on the market.Here is my proprietary bounce indicator in Flow mode. Notice anything? Flow trades which are bright green tiles on the chart tend to bunch together. Once a flow trade takes shape it tends to be followed by another.So what does that mean to us as retail traders?Simple. We only take a flow trade if the prior trade hit the take profit. If the prior trade was a loss we STOP TRADING until flow turn profitable again. Using this stop and go method we avoid the dreaded churn and increase our chance of winning trades tremendously.So here is the surprising takeaway for day trading. To trade counter trend you need to keep trying until you find the turn in the price action. But to trade trend you need stop and go stop and go until you sync yourself up with the trend move in the market.Thats pretty much the opposite of what most traders do - but now you know!"

Yahoo Finance , Older Americans say they feel trapped in Medicare Advantage plans, 2024-01-06,0.666667,"In 2016, Richard Timmins went to a free informational seminar to learn more about Medicare coverage.I listened to the insurance agent and, basically, he really promoted Medicare Advantage, Timmins said. The agent described less expensive and broader coverage offered by the plans, which are funded largely by the government but administered by private insurance companies.For Timmins, who is now 76, it made economic sense then to sign up. And his decision was great, for a while.Then, three years ago, he noticed a lesion on his right earlobe.I have a family history of melanoma. And so, I was kind of tuned in to that and thinking about that, Timmins said of the growth, which doctors later diagnosed as malignant melanoma. It started to grow and started to become rather painful.Timmins, though, discovered that his enrollment in a Premera Blue Cross Medicare Advantage plan would mean a limited network of doctors and the potential need for preapproval, or prior authorization, from the insurer before getting care. The experience, he said, made getting care more difficult, and now he wants to switch back to traditional, government-administered Medicare.But he cant. And hes not alone.I have very little control over my actual medical care, he said, adding that he now advises friends not to sign up for the private plans. I think that people are not understanding what Medicare Advantage is all about.Enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has grown substantially in the past few decades, enticing more than half of all eligible people, primarily those 65 or older, with low premium costs and perks like dental and vision insurance. And as the private plans share of the Medicare patient pie has ballooned to 30.8 million people, so too have concerns about the insurers aggressive sales tactics and misleading coverage claims.Enrollees, like Timmins, who sign on when they are healthy can find themselves trapped as they grow older and sicker.Story continuesIts one of those things that people might like them on the front end because of their low to zero premiums and if they are getting a couple of these extra benefits  the vision, dental, that kind of thing, said Christine Huberty, a lead benefit specialist supervising attorney for the Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources.But its when they actually need to use it for these bigger issues, Huberty said, thats when people realize, Oh no, this isnt going to help me at all.Medicare pays private insurers a fixed amount per Medicare Advantage enrollee and in many cases also pays out bonuses, which the insurers can use to provide supplemental benefits. Huberty said those extra benefits work as an incentive to get people to join the plan but that the plans then restrict the access to so many services and coverage for the bigger stuff.David Meyers, assistant professor of health services, policy, and practice at the Brown University School of Public Health, analyzed a decade of Medicare Advantage enrollment and found that
about 50% of beneficiaries
 rural and urban  left their contract by the end of five years. Most of those enrollees switched to another Medicare Advantage plan rather than traditional Medicare.In the study, Meyers and his co-authors muse that switching plans could be a positive sign of a free marketplace but that it could also signal unmeasured discontent with Medicare Advantage.The problem is that once you get into Medicare Advantage, if you have a couple of chronic conditions and you want to leave Medicare Advantage, even if Medicare Advantage isnt meeting your needs, you might not have any ability to switch back to traditional Medicare, Meyers said.Traditional Medicare can be too expensive for beneficiaries switching back from Medicare Advantage, he said. In traditional Medicare, enrollees pay a monthly premium and, after reaching a deductible, in most cases are expected to pay 20% of the cost of each nonhospital service or item they use. And there is no limit on how much an enrollee may have to pay as part of that 20% coinsurance if they end up using a lot of care, Meyers said.To limit what they spend out-of-pocket, traditional Medicare enrollees typically sign up for supplemental insurance, such as employer coverage or a private Medigap policy. If they are low-income, Medicaid may provide that supplemental coverage.But, Meyers said, theres a catch"

The entry said it was authorized by Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn, the judge.The Haslam family, Berkshire Hathaway and the chambers for Zurn could not be reached for comment.The two-day non-jury trial in Delaware's Court of Chancery was meant to determine the value of the Haslam family's 20% stake in Pilot Travel Centers, the largest U.S. truck stop chain.It was expected to feature testimony from Buffett's designated successor, Greg Abel.The Haslams, including Cleveland Browns football team owner Jimmy Haslam, sold Berkshire 80% of Pilot for $11 billion in two separate deals, in 2017 and January 2023.They also have a put option, allowing them to sell the remaining 20% in the first two months of any year.Pilot, which also operates under the Flying J brand, has about 650 locations and sold 13 billion gallons of fuel in 2022.Each side has accused the other of accounting tricks to manipulate the Knoxville, Tennessee-based company's earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, which determines the value of the Haslam's 20% stake.According to the Haslams, after Berkshire obtained the 80% Pilot stake it adopted ""pushdown accounting"" that would reduce how much it would owe if the put option were exercised.A lawyer for Berkshire said in court that depending on which side's accounting was used, EBIT would differ by $1.2 billion.The trial outcome would have turned on a simple question"

When the risk associated with any individual stock in your portfolio is high, spreading out your investments is essential. Ideally, the few big winners will more than offset the many losers.An alternative strategy is to avoid highly risky stocks altogether.

At the same time, strong global supply, including from the US, is raising the likelihood of a surplus that forced the OPEC+ group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, to extend output cuts into this year.State producer Saudi Aramco reduced its flagship Arab Light price to Asia by $2 to $1.50 a barrel above the benchmark. Thats bigger than a $1.25 a barrel reduction estimated in a Bloomberg survey of refiners and traders. Aramco also cut all prices for February delivery to Northwest Europe, Mediterranean and North America.Global crude prices declined in 2023 for the first time since 2020. The market has so far shrugged off concern over the Israel-Hamas war and deepening Middle East turmoil. Attacks by Houthi militants on merchant vessels transiting the Red Sea also havent yet resulted in supply disruptions.The OPEC+ groups production cuts are also aimed at preventing a buildup of oil in storage, amid concern a sluggish economy will crimp global demand. Saudi Arabia is taking on the bulk of the burden, with voluntary cuts of 2 million barrels a day through the first quarter and possibly longer.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Americas Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs

Yahoo Finance , What Should I Do With My IRA Once I Retire?, 2024-01-06,0.666667,"When you retire, you make the final shift from the era of wealth accumulation to wealth management.This is a big deal. Managing your
IRA
in retirement is an important project. You want to strike the balance between a newfound need for security, since you can no longer wait out downturns and replace losses, and a continued need for growth, since you will need this money for decades to come. Every household will have a different answer for how they want to manage their money, but here are a few things to consider as you approach retirement.To create a retirement strategy for your own goals, consider
speaking with a financial advisor
.Examine a Roth ConversionFirst things first, it's worth doing the math for a
Roth IRA conversion
.At any time, including when you retire, you can roll over your tax-advantaged retirement accounts from a pre-tax account (such as a
401(k)
or IRA) into a post-tax
Roth IRA
. While there are tax implications to doing this, there's no cap on the money that you can roll over.The advantage to this is that you can partially or entirely eliminate income taxes from your retirement portfolio. The disadvantage is that you will pay full income taxes on all of the money you roll over in the year you do so. And, while your Roth IRA will then continue to grow tax-free, the money you paid on that conversion could also have continued to grow. So there is both a present cost and an opportunity cost.If a Roth conversion works, it can be a significant long-term advantage. Just make sure that it will, in fact, work. Note than if you choose to roll your money over to a Roth, you may have to leave the money for five years before withdrawing to avoid penalties. A
financial advisor
can discuss the rules of retirement accounts with you.Rebalance for RiskPortfolio balance refers to the percent of assets make up the different sections of your retirement portfolio, such as stocks, funds and
bonds
.In your working life, your portfolio will be significantly balanced in favor of equities. Many advisors recommend that you hold between 60% and 80% of your retirement portfolio in assets like stocks and index funds while accumulating wealth.Story continuesIn retirement, your risk profile changes. You no longer have new income with which to replace losses and, arguably more importantly, you no longer have the time to wait out downturns. Even if the market dips, you will still need to cash out assets for your income. This argues for a balance toward security. But at the same time, you will likely need this money for decades to come. Inflation and costs will grow over time, and ideally you want your money to grow at a faster rate. This means you will still need some growth-oriented assets on hand.So as you retire, rebalance your IRA around these needs. On average, in your retirement you want your
IRA to hold between
40% and 70% low-risk assets like bonds.Create a specific plan that meets your needs for inflation and wealth management, while anticipating your needs for risk management.Balance Your Portfolios and RMDsYour IRA may be just one of several retirement portfolios that you manage. For example, you may have a 401(k) fund or a fully-taxed portfolio that you have used to build wealth.Households that have multiple portfolios often build a plan to use one at a time so that their other portfolios can maintain the highest possible returns. (Think of it, essentially, as an inverse
snowball method.
)This is a good approach, but it's important to have a strategy for which portfolios will you withdraw from, when and why.If you do this, make sure to keep an eye on required minimum distributions (RMDs). At age 73 the IRS will require you to take a minimum amount per year from each of your pre-tax accounts, including your IRA. You can manage this money as you want once you take it out, but you will need to withdraw it.Talk to a financial advisor
about the best ways to structure your RMDs.Manage Your TaxesFinally, as you plan for your IRA, make sure to account for taxes. Unless you make a Roth conversion, you will pay income taxes on the money that you regularly withdraw from your IRA. This can catch many retirees by surprise as, without fully realizing it, they plan to live on the full amount that they plan on withdrawing.Calculate the taxes that you will pay on your IRA withdrawals so that you can plan on living off that income, rather than the
hypothetical pre-tax income
.This will reflect your true financial position in retirement, and it's worth understanding.If you need help planning your taxes and retirement,
get matched with a financial advisor today.The Bottom LineAs you enter retirement, it's important to make a plan for your various retirement accounts. Look at rebalancing your assets, consider a Roth conversion and make a long-term plan for your taxes and lifestyle. And above all else, do not forget that money management doesn't end just because work did.Retirement Tax Management TipsManaging your taxes in retirement is essential.
You will pay taxes on just about every source of income except for Roth portfolios, including Social Security, so make sure that you maximize every advantage that you can get.
A financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

Yahoo Finance , Canada's Oil Sands Set for Expansion as Pipeline Nears Completion, 2024-01-07,0.555556,"Canadas oil producers plan higher output for this year and expect to earn more from their heavy crude once the long-delayed expanded Trans Mountain Pipeline enters into service.The start date of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion (TMX) is the key uncertainty this year for the Canadian oil industry, the benchmark Canadian heavy oil prices, and the revenues for the oil-producing province of Alberta.Despite this uncertainty about the additional export capacity from Albertas oil sands, some of the biggest Canadian producers plan to boost production in the short to medium term.The top liquids producer, Canadian Natural Resources, for example,
announced
last month its 2024 capital budget that targets exit 2024 production levels of around 1.455 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), up by around 40,000 boepd from the targeted exit 2023 production levels. The company also targets 2025 average annual production growth of approximately 4% to 5% compared to the 2024 average annual production levels.In the second half of the year, assuming commodities do not have material price declines in 2024, the program will shift to being weighted towards shorter cycle development opportunities to better align with incremental market egress, allowing us to maximize value for our shareholders, Canadian Natural Resources said in December.Cenovus Energy
plans to invest
capital this year primarily for progressing the West White Rose project as well as incrementally growing production at the Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Sunrise oil sands facilities.Analysts expect tie-backs to existing oil sands facilities or expansion of operational sites by some of the biggest Canadian oil firms
to boost
Canadas crude oil production by 8% by 2025.Key to that expanded production would be the progress of TMX, the project that the Federal Government of Canada
bought
from Kinder Morgan back in 2018, together with related pipeline and terminal assets.That cost the federal government $3.37 billion (C$4.5 billion) at the time. Since then, the costs for the expansion of the pipeline have quadrupled to nearly $23 billion (C$30.9 billion) and could continue to increase.Story continuesThe expansion project has also faced continuous delays over the years. The latest roadblock emerged in December when the Canadian regulator
denied
a variance request from the project developer to move a small section of the pipeline due to challenging drilling conditions. Trans Mountain is now waiting to receive the reasons for the decision, the corporation said, adding that construction on the project was more than 97.8% complete.Trans Mountain has previously said that it plans on achieving first oil on the expanded pipeline to the Westridge Marine Terminal by the end of the first quarter of 2024.This week, the company said it plans to
start line fill
in March or May, depending on the diameter of pipe it uses and assuming there would be no other setbacks.The expanded pipeline will triple the capacity of the original pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 300,000 bpd to carry crude from Albertas oil sands to British Columbia on the Pacific Coast.The sooner the expansion project is up and running, the higher Albertas takeaway capacity will be, narrowing the discount of the Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude to the U.S. benchmark WTI.Additional pipeline capacity to move oil out of the province next year is expected to support Alberta oil prices and narrow the discount between WTI and the Western Canadian Select (WCS). The completion of TMX in the second half of 2024 will help bring the differential to around US$14-15/bbl in the next two fiscal years, Albertas government
said
in its 2023-24 Mid-year Fiscal Update and Economic Statement in November.Producers are expected to continue drilling at a solid pace ahead of TMX coming online in the second half of 2024, the provincial government said.Increased takeaway capacity will help propel Albertas crude oil production from nearly 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023 to over four million barrels bpd by 2026.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"
Yahoo Finance , 3 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth, 2024-01-07,0.555556,"Many people think of long-term investing as buying and holding a stock for several years instead of succumbing to the psychological temptation of short-term trades.

Yahoo Finance , Older Americans say they feel trapped in Medicare Advantage plans, 2024-01-06,0.666667,"In 2016, Richard Timmins went to a free informational seminar to learn more about Medicare coverage.I listened to the insurance agent and, basically, he really promoted Medicare Advantage, Timmins said. The agent described less expensive and broader coverage offered by the plans, which are funded largely by the government but administered by private insurance companies.For Timmins, who is now 76, it made economic sense then to sign up. And his decision was great, for a while.Then, three years ago, he noticed a lesion on his right earlobe.I have a family history of melanoma. And so, I was kind of tuned in to that and thinking about that, Timmins said of the growth, which doctors later diagnosed as malignant melanoma. It started to grow and started to become rather painful.Timmins, though, discovered that his enrollment in a Premera Blue Cross Medicare Advantage plan would mean a limited network of doctors and the potential need for preapproval, or prior authorization, from the insurer before getting care. The experience, he said, made getting care more difficult, and now he wants to switch back to traditional, government-administered Medicare.But he cant. And hes not alone.I have very little control over my actual medical care, he said, adding that he now advises friends not to sign up for the private plans. I think that people are not understanding what Medicare Advantage is all about.Enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has grown substantially in the past few decades, enticing more than half of all eligible people, primarily those 65 or older, with low premium costs and perks like dental and vision insurance. And as the private plans share of the Medicare patient pie has ballooned to 30.8 million people, so too have concerns about the insurers aggressive sales tactics and misleading coverage claims.Enrollees, like Timmins, who sign on when they are healthy can find themselves trapped as they grow older and sicker.Story continuesIts one of those things that people might like them on the front end because of their low to zero premiums and if they are getting a couple of these extra benefits  the vision, dental, that kind of thing, said Christine Huberty, a lead benefit specialist supervising attorney for the Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources.But its when they actually need to use it for these bigger issues, Huberty said, thats when people realize, Oh no, this isnt going to help me at all.Medicare pays private insurers a fixed amount per Medicare Advantage enrollee and in many cases also pays out bonuses, which the insurers can use to provide supplemental benefits. Huberty said those extra benefits work as an incentive to get people to join the plan but that the plans then restrict the access to so many services and coverage for the bigger stuff.David Meyers, assistant professor of health services, policy, and practice at the Brown University School of Public Health, analyzed a decade of Medicare Advantage enrollment and found that
about 50% of beneficiaries
 rural and urban  left their contract by the end of five years. Most of those enrollees switched to another Medicare Advantage plan rather than traditional Medicare.In the study, Meyers and his co-authors muse that switching plans could be a positive sign of a free marketplace but that it could also signal unmeasured discontent with Medicare Advantage.The problem is that once you get into Medicare Advantage, if you have a couple of chronic conditions and you want to leave Medicare Advantage, even if Medicare Advantage isnt meeting your needs, you might not have any ability to switch back to traditional Medicare, Meyers said.Traditional Medicare can be too expensive for beneficiaries switching back from Medicare Advantage, he said. In traditional Medicare, enrollees pay a monthly premium and, after reaching a deductible, in most cases are expected to pay 20% of the cost of each nonhospital service or item they use. And there is no limit on how much an enrollee may have to pay as part of that 20% coinsurance if they end up using a lot of care, Meyers said.To limit what they spend out-of-pocket, traditional Medicare enrollees typically sign up for supplemental insurance, such as employer coverage or a private Medigap policy. If they are low-income, Medicaid may provide that supplemental coverage.But, Meyers said, theres a catch"

The entry said it was authorized by Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn, the judge.The Haslam family, Berkshire Hathaway and the chambers for Zurn could not be reached for comment.The two-day non-jury trial in Delaware's Court of Chancery was meant to determine the value of the Haslam family's 20% stake in Pilot Travel Centers, the largest U.S. truck stop chain.It was expected to feature testimony from Buffett's designated successor, Greg Abel.The Haslams, including Cleveland Browns football team owner Jimmy Haslam, sold Berkshire 80% of Pilot for $11 billion in two separate deals, in 2017 and January 2023.They also have a put option, allowing them to sell the remaining 20% in the first two months of any year.Pilot, which also operates under the Flying J brand, has about 650 locations and sold 13 billion gallons of fuel in 2022.Each side has accused the other of accounting tricks to manipulate the Knoxville, Tennessee-based company's earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, which determines the value of the Haslam's 20% stake.According to the Haslams, after Berkshire obtained the 80% Pilot stake it adopted ""pushdown accounting"" that would reduce how much it would owe if the put option were exercised.A lawyer for Berkshire said in court that depending on which side's accounting was used, EBIT would differ by $1.2 billion.The trial outcome would have turned on a simple question"

Charlie Munger
. ""The whole secret of investment is to find places where it is safe and wise not to diversify,"" Munger once said.For an investor focused on speculative growth stocks, diversification is the name of the game. When the risk associated with any individual stock in your portfolio is high, spreading out your investments is essential. Ideally, the few big winners will more than offset the many losers.An alternative strategy is to avoid highly risky stocks altogether. Instead, identify opportunities where the risk is low and few things need to go right for the stock to do well. That's Munger's investment strategy in a nutshell, and it's mine as well.The top three stocks in my portfolio make up 32% of the total value. The remaining 68% is split between 21 other stocks.

At the same time, strong global supply, including from the US, is raising the likelihood of a surplus that forced the OPEC+ group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, to extend output cuts into this year.State producer Saudi Aramco reduced its flagship Arab Light price to Asia by $2 to $1.50 a barrel above the benchmark.

Yahoo Finance , What Should I Do With My IRA Once I Retire?, 2024-01-06,0.666667,"When you retire, you make the final shift from the era of wealth accumulation to wealth management.This is a big deal. Managing your
IRA
in retirement is an important project. You want to strike the balance between a newfound need for security, since you can no longer wait out downturns and replace losses, and a continued need for growth, since you will need this money for decades to come. Every household will have a different answer for how they want to manage their money, but here are a few things to consider as you approach retirement.To create a retirement strategy for your own goals, consider
speaking with a financial advisor
.Examine a Roth ConversionFirst things first, it's worth doing the math for a
Roth IRA conversion
.At any time, including when you retire, you can roll over your tax-advantaged retirement accounts from a pre-tax account (such as a
401(k)
or IRA) into a post-tax
Roth IRA
. While there are tax implications to doing this, there's no cap on the money that you can roll over.The advantage to this is that you can partially or entirely eliminate income taxes from your retirement portfolio. The disadvantage is that you will pay full income taxes on all of the money you roll over in the year you do so. And, while your Roth IRA will then continue to grow tax-free, the money you paid on that conversion could also have continued to grow. So there is both a present cost and an opportunity cost.If a Roth conversion works, it can be a significant long-term advantage. Just make sure that it will, in fact, work. Note than if you choose to roll your money over to a Roth, you may have to leave the money for five years before withdrawing to avoid penalties. A
financial advisor
can discuss the rules of retirement accounts with you.Rebalance for RiskPortfolio balance refers to the percent of assets make up the different sections of your retirement portfolio, such as stocks, funds and
bonds
.In your working life, your portfolio will be significantly balanced in favor of equities. Many advisors recommend that you hold between 60% and 80% of your retirement portfolio in assets like stocks and index funds while accumulating wealth.Story continuesIn retirement, your risk profile changes. You no longer have new income with which to replace losses and, arguably more importantly, you no longer have the time to wait out downturns. Even if the market dips, you will still need to cash out assets for your income. This argues for a balance toward security. But at the same time, you will likely need this money for decades to come. Inflation and costs will grow over time, and ideally you want your money to grow at a faster rate. This means you will still need some growth-oriented assets on hand.So as you retire, rebalance your IRA around these needs. On average, in your retirement you want your
IRA to hold between
40% and 70% low-risk assets like bonds.Create a specific plan that meets your needs for inflation and wealth management, while anticipating your needs for risk management.Balance Your Portfolios and RMDsYour IRA may be just one of several retirement portfolios that you manage. For example, you may have a 401(k) fund or a fully-taxed portfolio that you have used to build wealth.Households that have multiple portfolios often build a plan to use one at a time so that their other portfolios can maintain the highest possible returns. (Think of it, essentially, as an inverse
snowball method.
)This is a good approach, but it's important to have a strategy for which portfolios will you withdraw from, when and why.If you do this, make sure to keep an eye on required minimum distributions (RMDs). At age 73 the IRS will require you to take a minimum amount per year from each of your pre-tax accounts, including your IRA. You can manage this money as you want once you take it out, but you will need to withdraw it.Talk to a financial advisor
about the best ways to structure your RMDs.Manage Your TaxesFinally, as you plan for your IRA, make sure to account for taxes. Unless you make a Roth conversion, you will pay income taxes on the money that you regularly withdraw from your IRA. This can catch many retirees by surprise as, without fully realizing it, they plan to live on the full amount that they plan on withdrawing.Calculate the taxes that you will pay on your IRA withdrawals so that you can plan on living off that income, rather than the
hypothetical pre-tax income
.This will reflect your true financial position in retirement, and it's worth understanding.If you need help planning your taxes and retirement,
get matched with a financial advisor today.The Bottom LineAs you enter retirement, it's important to make a plan for your various retirement accounts. Look at rebalancing your assets, consider a Roth conversion and make a long-term plan for your taxes and lifestyle. And above all else, do not forget that money management doesn't end just because work did.Retirement Tax Management TipsManaging your taxes in retirement is essential.
You will pay taxes on just about every source of income except for Roth portfolios, including Social Security, so make sure that you maximize every advantage that you can get.
A financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

The labor market added 216,000 jobs in December, about 40,000 more than the month prior and ahead of Wall Street's estimates for the latest report. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, a historically low level.Average hourly earnings, a closely watched indicator for inflation and a gauge of how much leverage workers have in the labor market, increased 0.4% on a monthly basis and 4.1% over last year; economists had expected wages to rise 0.3% over last month and 3.9% over last year.""The strength in the wage data argues for the Fed to remain on hold for a while longer,"" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""[Average hourly earnings are] running considerably faster than inflation over the past few months. The Fed is pleased with the progress they have made in getting inflation back down to 2%, but continued strength in [average hourly earnings] will make that 'last mile' problem even more difficult to solve.""Story continuesAs Simons nodded to, the debate on when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates continues to brew. Goldman Sachs still sees the first cut coming in March.""We continue to expect three consecutive 25bp cuts in the Fed funds rate in March, May, and June on the back of lower core inflation,"" Goldman's economics team led by Jan Hatzius wrote on Friday.For now, the market pricing is on Goldman's side, though odds are shifting. As of Friday afternoon, markets were placing a roughly 66% chance of a rate rate cut in March. A week ago, investors had placed a nearly 88% chance on a cut,
per the CME FedWatch Tool.Much of the debate around when the Fed will cut centers around how certain the central bank can be that inflation is indeed headed downward toward the Fed's 2% goal.More information on that will come in the week ahead with the December CPI print.Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose 3.2% annually in December,
a slight uptick from the 3.1% seen in November
. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, also a slight increase from the 0.1% in November.On a ""core"" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to rise 3.8% over last year in December, a slowdown from the 4.0% increase seen in November. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%.""On balance, we look for next week's CPI report to show that inflation continues to slow on trend in a way that positions the FOMC to start cutting rates in June,"" Wells Fargo's economics team wrote in a research note on Friday. ""Energy prices were more stable last month and are unlikely to repeat the major declines that occurred in October and November. We expect the disinflation in core goods to continue amid demand normalization, healthier supply chains and the fall in commodity prices from their peak.""On the corporate side, fourth quarter earnings season will kick off with heavy hitters. Delta Air Lines (
DAL
), JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and BlackRock are all set to report on Friday morning.Investors will look for updates on consumer spending as well as how financials are holding up amid the higher rate environment. The prospect of Fed interest rate cuts in 2024 could be a boost to bank stocks, according to Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo, who covers financials.""You saw with the Fed's pivot in December, bank stocks started to outperform,"" Mayo told Yahoo Finance Live. ""But when you actually see [the Fed rate cuts] happening, I think banks will perform even more. And I think the risk of the downside will be mitigated.""The financial sector will provide the first look at how corporates performed in the fourth quarter. Broadly, Wall Street has been increasingly pessimistic on fourth quarter earnings. Since September 30, estimates for S&P 500 earnings have fallen 6.8%,
per FactSet
. That marks the largest decline since the third quarter of 2022 and sits well above the 20-year average of a 3.8% decline.Deutsche Bank chief US equity strategist Binky Chadha sees a more robust quarter for earnings. But in the near-term, even that might not be a boost to the market, per Chadha, who notes stocks massive end of year rally puts equities in precarious position.""The size of the equity rally during earnings seasons has historically been tied largely to market performance and equity positioning going in,"" Chadha explained in a note to clients. ""Despite the robust growth and strong beats we expect this season, the market rally is likely to be tempered by the solid run up in the S&P 500 since the end of the previous earnings season and elevated (but not extreme) equity positioning.""Marquee at the main entrance to JPMorgan Chase headquarters building in Manhattan.

 Inveting.com, Bank Borrowing From Fed Bailout Program Has Surged, 2024-01-05,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Is a U.S. banking crisis still bubbling under the surface?
If activity in the Federal Reserves bank bailout program is any indication, the answer to that question is yes.
Over the last two months, the balance in the Fed Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has surged, and the pace of borrowing appears to be increasing.
Since Nov. 19, the amount of outstanding loans in the BTFP has increased by $27.3 billion. The balance in the bailout program grew by nearly $5.4 billion in just the last week.
As of Jan. 3, the balance in the BTFP stood at just over $141.2 billion. Its the largest balance since the program was created in March.
Borrowing had leveled off in August before the sudden spike in November. Keep in mind that banks were still tapping into the bailout even as the total balance in the program plateaued. Some banks were paying off loans as others borrowed.
This surge in bank bailout borrowing may indicate more banks are struggling in this high interest rate environment, and that the financial crisis that kicked off in March is still bubbling under the surface.The BTFP program is a sweetheart deal for banks struggling to raise short-term capital.

The debt continues to increase at a dizzying pace. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5, the national debt stood at $31.46 trillion. Since that time, the Biden administration has added $2.54 trillion to the national debt.
The government is running up the debt at roughly $1 trillion every three months. It eclipsed $32 trillion on June 15 and $33 trillion on September 15.
Since the beginning of 2016, the total debt has spiked by $15 trillion. Thats an 80 percent increase.
It's hard to wrap ones head around $34 trillion. To put things into perspective, every U.S. citizen would have to write a $101,234 check to pay off the debt. Every American taxpayer is on the hook for $264,090.
Or to look at it another way, $34 trillion is more than the total economies of China, Japan, Germany, and the UK combined.
Its a Spending Problem
The Biden administration likes to blame the ballooning debt on Republican tax cuts. But while federal receipts declined last year, they shrank from decade-high levels.
In fact, the government enjoyed a revenue windfall in 2022. According to a Tax Foundation analysis of Congressional Budget Office data, federal tax collections were up 21 percent that year. Tax collections also came in at a multi-decade high of 19.6 percent as a share of GDP. But at the time, CBO analysts warned the good times wouldnt last. And they didnt. Government receipts fell by 9.3 percent in fiscal 2023.
Falling revenues are certainly an issue, but you'll find the real problems on the spending side of the ledger.
On its way to the third-largest budget deficit in U.S. history, the Biden administration spent $6.46 trillion in fiscal 2023. That was an 8.8 percent year-over-year increase in actual spending.
You might think Congress solved this problem with the spending cuts in the debt ceiling deal (aka the [misnamed]
Fiscal Responsibility Act
). But we live in an upside-down world where spending cuts mean spending still goes up.
Even if Congress and the president managed to stick to the plan (and they wont), the so-called spending cuts will not put a dent in actual total spending. That means we can expect massive deficits to continue month after month.
This isnt to let Republicans off the hook. Despite occasionally paying lip service to fiscal responsibility, the GOP also borrows, spends, and runs big budget shortfalls.
To put the deficits into some historical perspective, before the pandemic, the U.S. government had only run budget deficits of over $1 trillion four times  all by the Obama administration in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.The Trump administration almost hit the $1 trillion mark in 2019 and was on pace to run a trillion-dollar deficit in fiscal 2020 prior to the pandemic, even as the U.S. supposedly enjoyed the best economy ever. The economic catastrophe caused by the governments response to COVID-19 gave policymakers an excuse to spend with no questions asked and we saw record deficits in fiscal 2020 and 2021.
Now the Biden administration has settled into the new status quo  running 08 financial crisis-like deficits every single year.
Notably, this relentless increase in debt is happening when the economy is supposedly strong. Typically, a strong
economy
generates more tax revenue, and deficits shrink. But this isnt really a strong economy. It is a house of cards built on debt. Fiscal stimulus is helping to prop it up.So What?
One of the most common responses I get when I talk about the national debt is, So what?
After all, the national debt has been expanding precipitously for years. Nothing has happened.
At least not yet.
But this is clearly an unsustainable trajectory.
This rapid increase in the national debt is happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills.
Interest expense rose by 23 percent to $879 billion in fiscal 2023. Net interest, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, rose by 39 percent to $659 billion. Both of those numbers broke records.Looking at Novembers interest expense puts things into a little sharper perspective.
Uncle Sam spent $79.92 billion in interest expense to finance the national debt in November. That was more than national defense ($70 billion) and more than Medicare ($79 billion). The only higher spending category was Social Security.
A lot of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month, some of that super-low-interest paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates.
The weighted average interest rate on the governments $26 trillion of outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.10 percent in November. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.22 percent in November 2022.Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words, the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
The bottom line is interest payments will continue to quickly climb much higher unless rates fall.
This may be one of the reasons the Federal Reserve is so eager to cut interest rates in 2024 despite price inflation being nowhere near the 2 percent target.
If the national debt climbs to $40 trillion and interest rates remain at 5 percent, interest payments on the debt would skyrocket around $2 trillion per year. That means that even if the U.S. government balanced the budget so receipts covered all spending minus interest payments, wed still be facing a $2 trillion annual deficit.
Of course, there wont be a balanced budget. So, lets assume the federal government can maintain the current deficit level of around $1 trillion annually (minus interest expense). Even with this overly optimistic scenario, the Treasury would be running a $3 trillion annual budget deficit. (Thats the current $1 trillion deficit plus $2 trillion in interest expenses.)
And the most likely scenario is spending will continue to climb, along with the budget deficits. Theres no telling how high the annual deficits could run.This is a fiscal powder keg. All it needs is a match.

 Inveting.com, US Dollar Recovers as 2024 Kicks Off, 2024-01-03,0.666667,"As we kick off January, it's common to witness some fluctuations in the stock market, primarily driven by portfolio adjustments and profit-taking activities. Many investors and fund managers engage in realigning their portfolios at the start of the year, often opting to realize profits from the previous year. This strategy is typically aimed at deferring tax liabilities, as these gains will be taxed in the new tax year, rather than in 2023.Concurrently, we might observe a rally in the US dollar. This trend is partly influenced by these portfolio adjustments, as investors may temporarily shift towards cash or dollar-denominated assets during this period of rebalancing.
However, it's important to note that these movements are often temporary.The market is likely to stabilize or even reverse these early trends as the month progresses and investment flows normalize. Additionally, today's release of the Federal Reserve minutes will offer more insights into the central bank's latest meetings. While significant changes in policy are not anticipated, the minutes will provide valuable context to their current stance and future outlook, potentially influencing market sentiments.Below you can also check my 2024 Elliott wave video outlook.Grega"
 Inveting.com, What Would It Take to Get a Depression?, 2023-12-27,0.222222,"By Peter St. Onge, PhD
So far this year, my base case on the economy has been that we're repeating the 1970's stagflation. With a first bout of high inflation followed by a period of rapid GDP growth that ends in a second, even worse, stagflation.
Going by the 70s, that second stagflation could go on for a long time considering the last one was only ended by a brutal series of engineered recessions that cost Jimmy Carter his job.
In other words, Washington won't make that mistake again  next time they'll just let it run.
All pretty dire, but there's actually another shoe to drop an even worse outcome that  going by commenters  a lot of people are worried about"

I think that as long as jobs data and inflation figures will not show the same picture for the economy, thats how long market can be a bit tricky and choppy on dollar pairs. From an Elliott wave perspective, I see DXY in a corrective a-b-c rally, back in wave four that can be moving into 104.50-105 resistance so technically trend is down, but we need some catalyst for the downtrend to resume.

It means Goldilocks must return from her Christmas trip to Aruba and appear this week.For December, the
ISM manufacturing
index is expected to rise to 47.1 from 46.7, while the service index falls to 52.5 from 52.7.
ADP
is expected to show 113,000 new jobs were created in December versus 103,000 in November.Finally, the official BLS job report
predicts
163,000 new jobs will have been made, down from 199,000 in November.Overall, these numbers are consistent with their prior trends and suggest no significant change in economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model indicates that the fourth quarter is growing by a 2.4% seasonally adjusted annualized rate.At least, based on the estimates, there doesnt seem to be enough to support rate cuts any time shortly. If it comes in as expected, I think that data is probably enough to turn higher the recent decline in rates and tighten financial conditions.By most standards, financial conditions have eased so much that the easing could have already substituted for rate cuts.In fact, over the last two months, the GS financial conditions index has reduced by its most ever. One could argue this could have a stimulative effect on the US economy as we move forward.On top of this, we have started to see shipping rates rising, as noted by the WCI Composite Container Freight Benchmark, which has increased from 1381 on November 30 to 1660 on December 21.It will be interesting to see if the recent increase in freight cost shows up in the ISM manufacturing Priced Paid PMI for December.There are no estimates currently, but the index was 49.9 in November. If one thing is clear, higher freight costs and easing financial conditions lead to higher prices over time.If this shows up, then I would think the recent decline in long-term rates will likely reverse; how high rates on the back of the curve go from here is unclear, but there are signs that the
10-year rate
can also go higher from a technical standpoint.The RSI is starting to consolidate and is even showing signs of turning higher. The big test will be when the 10-year reaches the 10-day exponential moving average and if it can breathe above that moving average.If the 10-year does break higher, the downtrend at 4% becomes the next target, and after that, we would be talking about a 10-year moving higher to around 4.35%.Overall, I think this will likely result in the
10/2
curve moving higher, with most of the heavy lifting coming from the back of the curve. It certainly appears like the curve is breaking out of a downtrend.As for the
S&P 500
, higher rates and steeper curves will present problems, especially if it is because we begin to start seeing the effects of easing financial conditions in this weeks data points.The S&P 500 also broke below a rising wedge pattern and is closing in on the 10-day exponential moving average, which hasnt been broken since November 2.That moving average comes at 4,745 and is around the zero gamma level.The zero gamma level is the line that separates positive from negative gamma; a break below the zero gamma level would push the index back into negative gamma and increase volatility. I still think a return to 4,100 over the next several weeks is likely.So, at this point, it seems a lot is riding on the data this week, and to keep the market moving higher, it will take the data coming in just right. Anything too hot or cold will be a big blow to the end-of-year rally.Original Post"

In the July top, the
S&P 500
stayed inside the engulfing candle of July 27 for three days before breaking lower. We also saw an inside day on December 7, which led to the continuation of the rally.However, the actual setup looks fairly negative from the standpoint that we had this big sell-off on Wednesday, and all the index did was retrace 61.8% of the decline thus far. Additionally, there was a big move lower into the close on Wednesday, with a gap higher this morning; those types of gaps tend to get filled quickly. Of course, it doesnt have to, but in my experience, it usually takes a day or two.Yesterday, we got the
GDP
revisions, and it was really surprising to see such large revisions coming through and revised downward, while jobless claims were also still very low. Still, the

Overall, GDP at 4.9% is still strong but down from 5.2%.More important is that the overall trend in the economic data over the past few weeks supports a pretty healthy 4Q real GDP growth rate, which supports higher rates from the back of the curve.

moving back above 4% seems possible over the near term.Additionally, the yield curve is getting close to steepening again, as the

 Inveting.com, What Is in Store for 2024, 2024-01-05,0.666667,"This year promises to be one of the most interesting years economically, politically, and market-wise in history. We have two significant global conflicts/wars ongoing, just as President Xi of China is reiterating his promise to annex Taiwan, and Kim Jong Un of North Korea threatens to wipe the US off the map. Meanwhile, we have the most likely Republican candidate getting thrown off state ballots under the disgusting guise of trying to preserve democracy. The US is sadly in the process of becoming a banana republic. Wars and revolutions are not a tail risk. They are happening now and are likely to metastasize in 2024.With this backdrop, we have the most expensive stock market in history prior to 2020. The price-to-sales ratio is 2.62, and the total market cap of equities is 176% of GDP; both figures are near record highs and dwarf the historical averages prior to the pandemic. And the equity risk premium is zero. Meaning the earnings yield of stocks is less than that yield offered by simply owning a risk-free T-bill. In other words, investors are not getting compensated at all for the extra risk of owning stocks over bonds.We think earnings growth this year will be in the low single digits at best. However, Wall Street gurus have penned in
S&P 500
EPS growth of nearly 12% this year. But even if that growth is somehow incredibly achieved, the market has already priced in that hope. The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.3. This P/E ratio is above the 5-year average of 18.8 and above the 10-year average 17.6, according to FactSet.Therefore, economic growth must absolutely soar in 2024 to justify these valuation metrics. Or, the Fed must slash borrowing costs back towards ZIRP. But the latter scenario would only occur if the Fed was reacting to an economy that was falling apart, which cannot be good news for stocks. Yet, even in the former scenario, the Fed would not be cutting rates at all. Nevertheless, there are 3 rate cuts indicated by the Feds dot plot, and the 6 cuts are being priced in by the futures market. Therefore, even in the highly unlikely scenario of exploding GDP this year, it would probably entail rising rates instead of rate cuts, which would still provide a headwind for stocks.The overhanging problem is that the Treasury must find a buyer for $7 trillion of government debt this year alone. $5 trillion must be rolled over, and $2 trillion will be needed to fund the annual deficit. This will put tremendous pressure on the bond market no matter what.The month of March will be key time for markets. The reverse repo facility should get run down in at the end of the Q1 or the start of Q2. That easy liquidity for the already illiquid bond market will disappear. March is also the month when the BTFP is scheduled to expire. This entails the process of the Fed selling $133 billion in Treasuries and MBS that are sharply underwater back to the banks; and in exchange, the banks pay 100 cents on the dollar to the Fed, plus interest. Powell needs to end this program to stop the rampant speculation on Wall Street and to ensure inflation retreats towards the 2% target. But doing so will wreak havoc on the regional banking system. His decision on this front will be critical.The recession penciled in for last year did not materialize because of the massive fiscal spending and the bailout of the entire regional banking system; a.k.a. BTFP. However, the conditions for engendering a recession have not been resolved, they have been exacerbatedregardless of the soft-landing mantra prevalent in the MSFM. They are screaming goldilocks while in reality, the economy is more fragile today than ever.This does not guarantee a recession; but it does virtually guarantee that a booming economy is not in the bag. And that means investors should not blindly own the S&P 500 and trust in a bull market that never ends.I very well understand that the Fed and Treasury will indeed seek to bailout every hiccup in the market and the economy. However, this is old news. The government rode to the rescue in the tech bubble recession at the turn of the millennia and during the global financial crisis and real estate crash of 2008. But neither ZIRP, or QE, or TARP, or any of the alphabet soup of bailout programs served to stop the 50% + debacle in markets.These inflationary bailouts do tend to paper over the issues eventually; but not immediately. And of course, they result in more problems that turn out to be much more dire and intractable in the long run. In the vanguard of these problems is another round of asset bubbles, even more debt being incurred, and the condition of out-of-control inflation, which further eviscerates the middle class.In sharp contrast to recent history, if the Fed and Treasury were to try and truncate the recession, debt default, and reconciliation of asset prices, by another round of money printing and spending this time around, they will be doing so with the sting of record-high inflation fresh in the minds of consumers and businesses and investors. Therefore, the confidence in the worlds reserve status of USD and the US bond market could be obliterated. Meaning, what we could very well see is a condition where the economy enters a recession but long-term bond yields go up instead of down as is usually the case. Such an unprecedented and dangerous combination of higher borrowing costs in a faltering economy would result in carnage for stock valuations.Financial conditions and credit spreads remain quiescent for now. Therefore, we remain net long in our Inflation/Deflation and Economic Cycle Model. But we remain ready to sprint for the narrow exit door once the sell signal is received.My prediction and admonishment for 2024, be prepared for everything.**Michael Pento is the President and Founder of

Money Metals Exchange
Is a U.S. banking crisis still bubbling under the surface?
If activity in the Federal Reserves bank bailout program is any indication, the answer to that question is yes.
Over the last two months, the balance in the Fed Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has surged, and the pace of borrowing appears to be increasing.
Since Nov. 19, the amount of outstanding loans in the BTFP has increased by $27.3 billion. The balance in the bailout program grew by nearly $5.4 billion in just the last week.
As of Jan. 3, the balance in the BTFP stood at just over $141.2 billion. Its the largest balance since the program was created in March.
Borrowing had leveled off in August before the sudden spike in November. Keep in mind that banks were still tapping into the bailout even as the total balance in the program plateaued. Some banks were paying off loans as others borrowed.
This surge in bank bailout borrowing may indicate more banks are struggling in this high interest rate environment, and that the financial crisis that kicked off in March is still bubbling under the surface.The BTFP program is a sweetheart deal for banks struggling to raise short-term capital.

Once the excesses of November-December are corrected, the overall trend this year still favours gold gains (for now),' said Ilya Spivak, the head of the global macro at Tastylive. Reduced interest rates lower the opportunity cost for holding non-yielding bullion. Investors should also keep a close watch on geopolitical events in the Middle East, where recent explosions in Iran have raised concerns about the possibility of an escalating conflict in the region.XAU/USD

Market declines, even in the range of 5-10%, happen every single year.So the sooner we learn that this is how markets work, the sooner we will learn how to invest well (I gladly leave the ability to go short, to do market timing, to others, I don't care).Another interesting fact, as we see from the image above, is that we have had 4 years historically where the first days of the year have been negative.In 3 out of 4 years (as happens in the long term) the markets have performed positively.So as always, my suggestion for 2024 is"

But that could change this week as earnings season kicks off and companies start announcing their plans for share repurchases, something investors hope will help the market keep last years rally running.Most Read from BloombergBoeing Max Grounding Goes Global as Carriers Follow FAA Order

Musks Drug Use Concerns Tesla, SpaceX Leaders, WSJ SaysBulls may need the support, as hedge funds and retail investors are tilted defensively following the strong end to the year, with worries around the timing of the Federal Reserves rate cuts adding to the caution.Im bullish on stocks in 2024, but its going to be a wild ride in the coming months since institutions are bearish, said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Reynolds Strategy, who correctly called the bear market during the 2008 global financial crisis. Once the selling runs its course, companies will buy back their shares to push stocks back up.US corporations have been reluctant to repurchase their shares as the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates higher to fight inflation, which raised borrowing costs. Buybacks have fallen for five straight quarters after hitting a record in 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. But with the Fed potentially getting ready to cut rates and earnings growth forecast to improve, investors expect more companies to deploy their newly available capital in the stock market.The fate of the stock market doesnt rest entirely on buybacks, however at nearly a trillion dollars a year, they represent one of the biggest buying forces around. S&P 500 companies spent nearly $800 billion on buybacks in the past year, down almost 20% from the same period the year before, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.S&P 500 firms are expected to spend at least $840 billion toward buybacks in 2024, according to preliminary data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a different methodology than Bloomberg. The 12-month expenditure through September of $787 billion was down nearly 20% from a year prior, S&P Dow Jones Indices said. The record was $923 billion in 2022.Story continuesOverall, total corporate buybacks fell 18% in the third quarter compared with the year prior, according to Wendy Soong, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. More than 40 S&P 500 companies announced buybacks in the fourth quarter worth a total of $163 billion, nearly a third less than a year ago in dollar value.Those companies include Cigna Group and Adobe Inc., both of which have cash on hand after planned corporate takeovers collapsed.Market TimingThe tricky part in all this for executives and investors will be finding the right time  both when to buy back the shares and when to expect them to pop. The key may lie in the Feds plans for rate cuts, which officials have signaled might not occur until mid-2024 or even later. That could prevent companies from borrowing money for repurchases until later this year or early 2025, according to Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial Group.Still, buybacks appear ready to make a comeback. Capital spending as a share of sales has recovered to the pre-pandemic five-year average, partly due to surging allocations by the so-called Magnificent Seven tech giants, led by Apple Inc. Despite the companys challenges in China, its repurchase plans mean its shares continue to have upside potential after their nearly 50% gain in 2023, said Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments Inc.Buybacks are a way to solve problems for companies when their profit growth slows, said Tengler. We arent buying Apple for the fundamentals. We buy it because the company will put a floor on the stock every single time it falls.Other companies are getting that message as well. Take Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc., the Lake Success, New York-based provider of investor communications and technology products, with a market capitalization of over $23 billion. It plans to spend about $500 million on buybacks during its current fiscal year.I expect our shareholder returns will be more weighted toward buybacks as there isnt a lot to buy in terms of M&A, Chief Financial Officer Edmund Reese said in an interview. Buybacks help the stock.--With assistance from Tom Contiliano and Nina Trentmann.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Americas Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs
