 Inveting.com,Bank Borrowing From Fed Bailout Program Has Surged,2024-01-05,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Is a U.S. banking crisis still bubbling under the surface?
If activity in the Federal Reserves bank bailout program is any indication,the answer to that question is yes.
Over the last two months,the balance in the Fed Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has surged,and the pace of borrowing appears to be increasing.
Since Nov. 19,the amount of outstanding loans in the BTFP has increased by $27.3 billion. The balance in the bailout program grew by nearly $5.4 billion in just the last week.
As of Jan. 3,the balance in the BTFP stood at just over $141.2 billion. Its the largest balance since the program was created in March.
Borrowing had leveled off in August before the sudden spike in November. Keep in mind that banks were still tapping into the bailout even as the total balance in the program plateaued. Some banks were paying off loans as others borrowed.
This surge in bank bailout borrowing may indicate more banks are struggling in this high interest rate environment,and that the financial crisis that kicked off in March is still bubbling under the surface.The BTFP program is a sweetheart deal for banks struggling to raise short-term capital.

 Inveting.com,National Debt Tops $34 Trillion but so What?,2024-01-04,0.333333,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
On Dec. 29,the national debt slipped above $34 trillion for the first time.
On the date,the debt was $34,001,493,655,565.48,to be exact.
But so what?Despite a few alarming headlines,nobody really seems to care. In fact,NPR did a story highlighting the supposed ""benefits"" of a massive national debt.
The debt continues to increase at a dizzying pace. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5,the national debt stood at $31.46 trillion. Since that time,the Biden administration has added $2.54 trillion to the national debt.
The government is running up the debt at roughly $1 trillion every three months. It eclipsed $32 trillion on June 15 and $33 trillion on September 15.
Since the beginning of 2016,the total debt has spiked by $15 trillion. Thats an 80 percent increase.
It's hard to wrap ones head around $34 trillion. To put things into perspective,every U.S. citizen would have to write a $101,234 check to pay off the debt. Every American taxpayer is on the hook for $264,090.
Or to look at it another way,$34 trillion is more than the total economies of China,Japan,Germany,and the UK combined.
Its a Spending Problem
The Biden administration likes to blame the ballooning debt on Republican tax cuts. But while federal receipts declined last year,they shrank from decade-high levels.
In fact,the government enjoyed a revenue windfall in 2022. According to a Tax Foundation analysis of Congressional Budget Office data,federal tax collections were up 21 percent that year. Tax collections also came in at a multi-decade high of 19.6 percent as a share of GDP. But at the time,CBO analysts warned the good times wouldnt last. And they didnt. Government receipts fell by 9.3 percent in fiscal 2023.
Falling revenues are certainly an issue,but you'll find the real problems on the spending side of the ledger.
On its way to the third-largest budget deficit in U.S. history,the Biden administration spent $6.46 trillion in fiscal 2023. That was an 8.8 percent year-over-year increase in actual spending.
You might think Congress solved this problem with the spending cuts in the debt ceiling deal (aka the [misnamed]
Fiscal Responsibility Act
). But we live in an upside-down world where spending cuts mean spending still goes up.
Even if Congress and the president managed to stick to the plan (and they wont),the so-called spending cuts will not put a dent in actual total spending. That means we can expect massive deficits to continue month after month.
This isnt to let Republicans off the hook. Despite occasionally paying lip service to fiscal responsibility,the GOP also borrows,spends,and runs big budget shortfalls.
To put the deficits into some historical perspective,before the pandemic,the U.S. government had only run budget deficits of over $1 trillion four times  all by the Obama administration in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.The Trump administration almost hit the $1 trillion mark in 2019 and was on pace to run a trillion-dollar deficit in fiscal 2020 prior to the pandemic,even as the U.S. supposedly enjoyed the best economy ever. The economic catastrophe caused by the governments response to COVID-19 gave policymakers an excuse to spend with no questions asked and we saw record deficits in fiscal 2020 and 2021.
Now the Biden administration has settled into the new status quo  running 08 financial crisis-like deficits every single year.
Notably,this relentless increase in debt is happening when the economy is supposedly strong. Typically,a strong
economy
generates more tax revenue,and deficits shrink. But this isnt really a strong economy. It is a house of cards built on debt. Fiscal stimulus is helping to prop it up.So What?
One of the most common responses I get when I talk about the national debt is,So what?
After all,the national debt has been expanding precipitously for years. Nothing has happened.
At least not yet.
But this is clearly an unsustainable trajectory.
This rapid increase in the national debt is happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills.
Interest expense rose by 23 percent to $879 billion in fiscal 2023. Net interest,excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds,rose by 39 percent to $659 billion. Both of those numbers broke records.Looking at Novembers interest expense puts things into a little sharper perspective.
Uncle Sam spent $79.92 billion in interest expense to finance the national debt in November. That was more than national defense ($70 billion) and more than Medicare ($79 billion). The only higher spending category was Social Security.
A lot of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month,some of that super-low-interest paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates.
The weighted average interest rate on the governments $26 trillion of outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.10 percent in November. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.22 percent in November 2022.Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words,the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
The bottom line is interest payments will continue to quickly climb much higher unless rates fall.
This may be one of the reasons the Federal Reserve is so eager to cut interest rates in 2024 despite price inflation being nowhere near the 2 percent target.
If the national debt climbs to $40 trillion and interest rates remain at 5 percent,interest payments on the debt would skyrocket around $2 trillion per year. That means that even if the U.S. government balanced the budget so receipts covered all spending minus interest payments,wed still be facing a $2 trillion annual deficit.
Of course,there wont be a balanced budget. So,lets assume the federal government can maintain the current deficit level of around $1 trillion annually (minus interest expense). Even with this overly optimistic scenario,the Treasury would be running a $3 trillion annual budget deficit. (Thats the current $1 trillion deficit plus $2 trillion in interest expenses.)
And the most likely scenario is spending will continue to climb,along with the budget deficits. Theres no telling how high the annual deficits could run.This is a fiscal powder keg. All it needs is a match.

 Inveting.com,US Dollar Recovers as 2024 Kicks Off,2024-01-03,0.666667,"As we kick off January,it's common to witness some fluctuations in the stock market,primarily driven by portfolio adjustments and profit-taking activities. Many investors and fund managers engage in realigning their portfolios at the start of the year,often opting to realize profits from the previous year. This strategy is typically aimed at deferring tax liabilities,as these gains will be taxed in the new tax year,rather than in 2023.Concurrently,we might observe a rally in the US dollar. This trend is partly influenced by these portfolio adjustments,as investors may temporarily shift towards cash or dollar-denominated assets during this period of rebalancing.
However,it's important to note that these movements are often temporary.The market is likely to stabilize or even reverse these early trends as the month progresses and investment flows normalize. Additionally,today's release of the Federal Reserve minutes will offer more insights into the central bank's latest meetings. While significant changes in policy are not anticipated,the minutes will provide valuable context to their current stance and future outlook,potentially influencing market sentiments.Below you can also check my 2024 Elliott wave video outlook.Grega"
 Inveting.com,What Would It Take to Get a Depression?,2023-12-27,0.222222,"By Peter St. Onge,PhD
So far this year,my base case on the economy has been that we're repeating the 1970's stagflation. With a first bout of high inflation followed by a period of rapid GDP growth that ends in a second,even worse,stagflation.
Going by the 70s,that second stagflation could go on for a long time considering the last one was only ended by a brutal series of engineered recessions that cost Jimmy Carter his job.
In other words,Washington won't make that mistake again  next time they'll just let it run.
All pretty dire,but there's actually another shoe to drop an even worse outcome that  going by commenters  a lot of people are worried about"
 Inveting.com," US Dollar Index Moves Toward Resistance Ahead of CPI,Fed Decision",2023-12-11,0.666667,"We have a busy week with plenty of economic data,which certainly should have an important impact on the markets. One of the most important will be the US inflation report which is expected to come down from 3.2% to 3.1% y/y and then also FED rates decision on Wednesday,so it will be interesting to see if dollar can see new bear trend once more,after some strong US jopbs data last week. I think that as long as jobs data and inflation figures will not show the same picture for the economy,thats how long market can be a bit tricky and choppy on dollar pairs. From an Elliott wave perspective,I see DXY in a corrective a-b-c rally,back in wave four that can be moving into 104.50-105 resistance so technically trend is down,but we need some catalyst for the downtrend to resume.

That said,we may see some pullback that will allow us to be short dollars from better levels. Looking at the Elliott wave structure,I surely would not be surprised to see wave four here,if current hourly trendline support is broken. US yields have five down as well.

CPI
came down more than expected yesterday at 3.2% y/y,and as a result the USD fell sharply with US yeilds,while stocks and metals are on the rise. For now,this seems to be a very important data as it causes also a very important key breakdown on USD index and US yeilds.Looking at the US yeilds,we have five waves down,so it means that top is in place,and suggests that speculators believe that FED is done with hiking. But keep in mind that if energy (crude for example) will turn back up this month then again inflation expectations and rate policy may change and influence investors' moods.So tracking
crude oil
in the next few weeks is crucial. Also,keep in mind that a pullback on US yields can show up soon,and it can force some dollar shorts from yesterday to liquidate. But that's yet to be seen,as I realize that pullbacks may not be that deep after all.But for now,at least the intraday direction is clear and bearish for the DXY,where we may see a continuation to around 103-103.40 where we see 50 and 100 Weekly MA."

 Inveting.com,Stocks Week Ahead,2024-01-08,0.666667,"This week will be another in-focus week,with the
CPI
and
PPI
reports coming toward the weeks end.Additionally,3 Treasury auctions will be front and center as well. This will follow a fairly previous strong week of data,which suggests the US economy is hanging in nicely.Currently,Bloomberg Economics
GDP
Nowcast is forecasting fourth-quarter growth of around 2.3%,which is slower than the roughly 5% third-quarter print but still a respectable growth rate.Coupled with a roughly 3%
inflation
rate,nominal growth is still around 5ish %. Again,it is a health level.Given a 5% nominal growth rate,I think it will be tough to see the Fed cut rates at the moment as aggressively as the market has priced in.As of the third quarter,Nominal GDP y/y growth was still above the Fed Funds rate,and even with a 5% nominal growth in the fourth,the Fed Funds rate and nominal growth would be almost equal.It isnt until the Fed funds rate is 0.5% to 1% higher than nominal growth that downward pressure is exerted on the economy,and the odds for recession seem to increase.So I think,at the bare minimum,the Fed can continue to be patient and see what the data says,and the CPI report this week may or may not help that cause.The median expectation is for an increase of 3.2% in December,while inflation swaps are priced at an increase of 3.32%.If we look back at the data over the last few months when rounding to the nearest 0.1%,swaps have only overestimated CPI 1 time out of the last six times.At the same time,the median has overestimated the actual CPI 3 times.So,if we care about when the CPI has come in hotter than expected,the inflation swaps have had a better run,so one should be mindful of the risk that CPI comes in above the consensus of 3.2% this month.If the swap data turns out to be right,given where GDP growth in nominal terms appears to be,the odds of the Fed cutting rates as aggressively as the market has priced will likely not be supported by the data.Fed Funds policy will need to be held in place for some time longer.The Fed sees rates around 4.65% at the end of 2024,while swaps are trading at 3.78% and Fed Fund Futures are trading at 3.94%. The gap is too wide and will need to be closed.This will likely result in rates across the curve rising further because assuming a 2% inflation rate,with the 5-year trading at 4%,suggests a Fed funds rate of 2%,lower than the Feds longer-run rate of 2.5%.So it would probably suggest a 50 bps upside to the 5-year from current levels and the entire curve.While it doesnt suggest a
10-year
rate moving back to the October higher,it does suggest a 10-year rate perhaps moving back to 4.5 to 4.6%.Given that the 10-year is showing positive and strong momentum from a break out in the relative strength index and a strong break out from a downtrend on the price chart,it wont take much,perhaps more than a close above the 200-day moving average,to get the 10-year moving higher towards 4.25% to 4.3%.Inflation data may only add to the breakout that already appears to be taking place.The
dollar
would also likely get a boost. While the dollar isnt as well positioned as the 10-year currently,It is getting closer to seeing a significant breakout,with an RSI trending higher overall and breaking free in several key spots.If the
DXY
can clear the 102.65 region,it has room to run to around 103.50 and test horizontal resistance and the 200-day moving average.The
S&P 500
is also on its way lower and has recently fallen below its 10-day exponential and 20-day simple moving averages,with the lower Bollinger band around 4,580 being one potential target.Of course,it is not uncommon that when an index hits the upper Bollinger Band,it retraces to the lower Bollinger band over time,and in that case,that would be around 4,100 on the weekly chart.It isnt uncommon on the monthly chart,meaning a revisit to the lows of around 3,600. Because that is what happened in mid-2022,early 2020,late 2018,and in parts of 2016.The December 2023 rally pushed the index above the upper Bollinger band. We are now in 2024,of course. Have you noticed the trend?The market has been very aggressive with rate cuts,and rate cuts to the degree the market has priced doesnt look rightalso,the earnings multiple of the S&P 500 is too high at 19.4.The median PE ratio for a 12-month forward S&P 500 is 16.4; at roughly $242 in earnings per share,the value of the S&P 500 would be around 3,960.That is,assuming that earnings grow by 10%,should they grow by just 5%,and are instead $231 per share,the value drops to 3,790.So,from a fundamental and technical basis,a drop back towards the lower monthly Bollinger band should not be completely ruled out or viewed as fiction.The fundamentals and technical aspects suggest it be possible,especially if rates increase again and earnings dont live up to the hype.Enjoy the final week of Football.

It means Goldilocks must return from her Christmas trip to Aruba and appear this week.For December,the
ISM manufacturing
index is expected to rise to 47.1 from 46.7,while the service index falls to 52.5 from 52.7.
ADP
is expected to show 113,000 new jobs were created in December versus 103,000 in November.Finally,the official BLS job report
predicts
163,000 new jobs will have been made,down from 199,000 in November.Overall,these numbers are consistent with their prior trends and suggest no significant change in economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model indicates that the fourth quarter is growing by a 2.4% seasonally adjusted annualized rate.At least,based on the estimates,there doesnt seem to be enough to support rate cuts any time shortly. If it comes in as expected,I think that data is probably enough to turn higher the recent decline in rates and tighten financial conditions.By most standards,financial conditions have eased so much that the easing could have already substituted for rate cuts.In fact,over the last two months,the GS financial conditions index has reduced by its most ever. One could argue this could have a stimulative effect on the US economy as we move forward.On top of this,we have started to see shipping rates rising,as noted by the WCI Composite Container Freight Benchmark,which has increased from 1381 on November 30 to 1660 on December 21.It will be interesting to see if the recent increase in freight cost shows up in the ISM manufacturing Priced Paid PMI for December.There are no estimates currently,but the index was 49.9 in November. If one thing is clear,higher freight costs and easing financial conditions lead to higher prices over time.If this shows up,then I would think the recent decline in long-term rates will likely reverse; how high rates on the back of the curve go from here is unclear,but there are signs that the
10-year rate
can also go higher from a technical standpoint.The RSI is starting to consolidate and is even showing signs of turning higher. The big test will be when the 10-year reaches the 10-day exponential moving average and if it can breathe above that moving average.If the 10-year does break higher,the downtrend at 4% becomes the next target,and after that,we would be talking about a 10-year moving higher to around 4.35%.Overall,I think this will likely result in the
10/2
curve moving higher,with most of the heavy lifting coming from the back of the curve. It certainly appears like the curve is breaking out of a downtrend.As for the
S&P 500
,higher rates and steeper curves will present problems,especially if it is because we begin to start seeing the effects of easing financial conditions in this weeks data points.The S&P 500 also broke below a rising wedge pattern and is closing in on the 10-day exponential moving average,which hasnt been broken since November 2.That moving average comes at 4,745 and is around the zero gamma level.The zero gamma level is the line that separates positive from negative gamma; a break below the zero gamma level would push the index back into negative gamma and increase volatility. I still think a return to 4,100 over the next several weeks is likely.So,at this point,it seems a lot is riding on the data this week,and to keep the market moving higher,it will take the data coming in just right. Anything too hot or cold will be a big blow to the end-of-year rally.Original Post"

 Inveting.com,Reconsidering the Dovish Fed Expectations,2024-01-08,0.555556,"The New Year unsurprisingly kicked off with a hangover for both stock and bond markets,as investors began the year by closing their positions and taking profit following an impressive two-month rally that was boosted by the expectation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would soon start cutting the interest rates and cut them thoroughly throughout this year. We begin the new year with the expectation that the Fed will cut the rates 5 times,by 25bp each,and the first rate cut will be announced by March,with around 64% probability. Note that this probability was standing somewhere around 80% by the end of last year and its come down,as investors probably realized that the expectations and the market rally went well ahead of themselves. And of course,the minutes from the Feds last meeting,released last week,didnt give any clarity other than the general thinking that the Fed rates are certainly at or near their peak for this cycle,but that there is an unusually elevated degree of uncertainty meaning that the expectation of around 75bp cut this year is certainly not a done deal. And indeed,the strength of the US economy and its jobs market wouldnt justify an imminent start of the Fed cuts this spring.In this context,last weeks jobs data from the US came in stronger than expected,yet again. The US economy added more than 200000 new nonfarm jobs in December,and the average earnings accelerated more than expected,above 4%. Some saw a bit of weakness in the US job metrics pointing at the falling job openings and the falling participation rate,but rationally speaking,an NFP figure above 200K is not pointing at a severe slowdown which would urge the Fed to start cutting the rates in two-and-something month and cut by 150bp to the end of the year. Even Janet Yellen said it  in quite an unusual declaration after Fridays jobs report said that what we are seeing now I think we can describe as soft landing,and again a soft landing doesnt justify a 150bp cut from the Fed this year.As such,there is no surprise that we see the
US 2-year
yield rebound to 4.40% and the 10-year yield return past the 4% - its biggest weekly advance of the
US 10-year
yield since October. The rising yields halted the
dollar
s bleeding. The
EUR/USD
sank below the 1.10 mark as soon as the year started. The rising US yields also stopped the rally in equities. The
S&P 500
dipped below 4700  having been unable to post a fresh record at the end of the latest rally,and the rate-sensitive
Nasdaq 100
fell more than 4% since its December peak  which was an ATH. And because the correlation between the US treasuries and Nasdaq 100 stocks remains high,a further rise in the US yields will likely cause a deeper retreat for the US stocks  and especially the most-loved tech stocks. But note that this correlation will likely decline with the start of the earnings season this week,as the company results will give investors a various range of reasons to buy or sell stocks. Overall,according to FactSet,the estimated yoy earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 1.3% for the Q4. If thats the case,it will mark the second straight quarter of year-over-year earnings growth for the index,and its another evidence that the US economy doesnt need the Feds help to stay afloat.This weeks major economic data is the US inflation data due Thursday. The headline inflation in the US is expected to have slowly accelerated to 3.2% from 3.1% printed a month earlier,while core inflation is expected to have further eased to 3.8% from 4% printed a month earlier. Soft inflation numbers,ideally softer-than-expected,could slow the corrective selloff in both stock and bond markets,yet the inflation risks are now tilted to the upside. Tensions in the Red Sea region explode the price of shipping goods from Asia to Europe and America. The cost of shipping goods from Asia to Europe doubled since last December,and thats a bad indication of whats to come for inflation numbers in the coming months. Remember,the last time we saw the shipping costs surge  that was during the pandemic  had followed a significant rise in a very wide range of consumer prices. Therefore yes,inflation figures in US and Europe have come significantly down last year,but the easing could slow or reverse. And thats the biggest risk to the dovish Fed and European Central Bank (ECB),and Bank of England (BoE) expectations this year.Happily,though,the oil prices continue to see strong resistance despite the Red Sea tensions. The barrel of
US crude
couldnt clear the $74 offers last week and we start the week below the $73pb level. The geopolitical risks prevail,but traders continue to see the tops in an effort to force the price of a barrel of American crude to below $70pb again."

 Inveting.com,Did Markets Get Ahead of Themselves? December Surge Faces Reality Check in January,2024-01-08,0.666667,"Markets rose last month,continuing Novembers rally as interest rates pulled back even more on expectations of Fed rate cuts in 2024. Markets in the U.S. were up by mid-single digits,finishing a solid quarter and a very strong year. International markets were also up substantially for the month,quarter,and year. And while stocks were hot,even fixed income posted enough gains to close out the year in the black. 2023 ended with a bang.Interest rates. The rally was,once again,due mainly to interest rates,which kept dropping in December. Better inflation numbers raised hopes the Fed would start cutting rates this year,and signs of slower but continued economic growth supported that idea.Between job growth moving closer to pre-pandemic levels,healthy consumer confidence and spending,and continued weakness in manufacturing,the economy seemed to be settling into a soft landing,which could keep pulling inflation downward. In response,the
10-year
U.S. Treasury yield dropped back to levels last seen in August,driving markets higher.Changing expectations. Looking forward,we may see a change in expectations in the new year. Markets have been choppy so far this month,and there is commentary suggesting that they may have gotten ahead of themselves.After a strong year-end,the seasonal factors can be less positive at the start of the year,which could be a headwind. In addition,the Fed may start pushing back on rate cut expectations,which would be another negative. Overall,in my view,conditions should remain positive in January,but perhaps somewhat less so than last month.Current risks. While overall conditions remain positive,there are still risks. The Fed is concerned that inflation may return in some sectors,which must be watched for its effect on rates.The ongoing war in the Middle East shows signs of expanding and affecting trade routes and supply lines. And domestic politics remain a concern as the election gets closer. But with the fundamentals reasonably healthy and the macro picture stabilizing,many of the economic fears that pulled markets back last year may subside.The markets and inflation. As we start the year,the key issues will be whether growth continues at a slower rate and inflation moves downward. Market expectations on rates have changed rapidly. If the Fed continues to act in a dovish manner,that positive reaction could continue. That said,there is a mismatch between what the market expects (six or more rate cuts) and what the Fed says (only three rate cuts).That mismatch in the past has given rise to volatility,so this is a risk to watch,even if conditions otherwise remain favorable.That is the bottom line herewhile conditions are good,volatility looks likely. The last two months were great for markets as rates pulled back,but conditions could change. Looking forward to the new year,we are still not out of the woods with inflation or growth. And while the trends remain positive,risks may pick up again over the next couple of months.As of this mornings jobs report,job growth is still healthy. The things to watch going forward will be consumer confidence and consumer spending. If they remain at pre-pandemic levels,then a soft landing looks increasingly likely,and the Fed should continue to send dovish signals. If not,we could see more volatility.Even in the case of volatility,the solid fundamentals should limit the damage and help set us up for more growth later this year. I believe this is something to watch for,but not to worry about too much."
 Inveting.com,What Is in Store for 2024,2024-01-05,0.666667,"This year promises to be one of the most interesting years economically,politically,and market-wise in history. We have two significant global conflicts/wars ongoing,just as President Xi of China is reiterating his promise to annex Taiwan,and Kim Jong Un of North Korea threatens to wipe the US off the map. Meanwhile,we have the most likely Republican candidate getting thrown off state ballots under the disgusting guise of trying to preserve democracy. The US is sadly in the process of becoming a banana republic. Wars and revolutions are not a tail risk. They are happening now and are likely to metastasize in 2024.With this backdrop,we have the most expensive stock market in history prior to 2020. The price-to-sales ratio is 2.62,and the total market cap of equities is 176% of GDP; both figures are near record highs and dwarf the historical averages prior to the pandemic. And the equity risk premium is zero. Meaning the earnings yield of stocks is less than that yield offered by simply owning a risk-free T-bill. In other words,investors are not getting compensated at all for the extra risk of owning stocks over bonds.We think earnings growth this year will be in the low single digits at best. However,Wall Street gurus have penned in
S&P 500
EPS growth of nearly 12% this year. But even if that growth is somehow incredibly achieved,the market has already priced in that hope. The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.3. This P/E ratio is above the 5-year average of 18.8 and above the 10-year average 17.6,according to FactSet.Therefore,economic growth must absolutely soar in 2024 to justify these valuation metrics. Or,the Fed must slash borrowing costs back towards ZIRP. But the latter scenario would only occur if the Fed was reacting to an economy that was falling apart,which cannot be good news for stocks. Yet,even in the former scenario,the Fed would not be cutting rates at all. Nevertheless,there are 3 rate cuts indicated by the Feds dot plot,and the 6 cuts are being priced in by the futures market. Therefore,even in the highly unlikely scenario of exploding GDP this year,it would probably entail rising rates instead of rate cuts,which would still provide a headwind for stocks.The overhanging problem is that the Treasury must find a buyer for $7 trillion of government debt this year alone. $5 trillion must be rolled over,and $2 trillion will be needed to fund the annual deficit. This will put tremendous pressure on the bond market no matter what.The month of March will be key time for markets. The reverse repo facility should get run down in at the end of the Q1 or the start of Q2. That easy liquidity for the already illiquid bond market will disappear. March is also the month when the BTFP is scheduled to expire. This entails the process of the Fed selling $133 billion in Treasuries and MBS that are sharply underwater back to the banks; and in exchange,the banks pay 100 cents on the dollar to the Fed,plus interest. Powell needs to end this program to stop the rampant speculation on Wall Street and to ensure inflation retreats towards the 2% target. But doing so will wreak havoc on the regional banking system. His decision on this front will be critical.The recession penciled in for last year did not materialize because of the massive fiscal spending and the bailout of the entire regional banking system; a.k.a. BTFP. However,the conditions for engendering a recession have not been resolved,they have been exacerbatedregardless of the soft-landing mantra prevalent in the MSFM. They are screaming goldilocks while in reality,the economy is more fragile today than ever.This does not guarantee a recession; but it does virtually guarantee that a booming economy is not in the bag. And that means investors should not blindly own the S&P 500 and trust in a bull market that never ends.I very well understand that the Fed and Treasury will indeed seek to bailout every hiccup in the market and the economy. However,this is old news. The government rode to the rescue in the tech bubble recession at the turn of the millennia and during the global financial crisis and real estate crash of 2008. But neither ZIRP,or QE,or TARP,or any of the alphabet soup of bailout programs served to stop the 50% + debacle in markets.These inflationary bailouts do tend to paper over the issues eventually; but not immediately. And of course,they result in more problems that turn out to be much more dire and intractable in the long run. In the vanguard of these problems is another round of asset bubbles,even more debt being incurred,and the condition of out-of-control inflation,which further eviscerates the middle class.In sharp contrast to recent history,if the Fed and Treasury were to try and truncate the recession,debt default,and reconciliation of asset prices,by another round of money printing and spending this time around,they will be doing so with the sting of record-high inflation fresh in the minds of consumers and businesses and investors. Therefore,the confidence in the worlds reserve status of USD and the US bond market could be obliterated. Meaning,what we could very well see is a condition where the economy enters a recession but long-term bond yields go up instead of down as is usually the case. Such an unprecedented and dangerous combination of higher borrowing costs in a faltering economy would result in carnage for stock valuations.Financial conditions and credit spreads remain quiescent for now. Therefore,we remain net long in our Inflation/Deflation and Economic Cycle Model. But we remain ready to sprint for the narrow exit door once the sell signal is received.My prediction and admonishment for 2024,be prepared for everything.**Michael Pento is the President and Founder of

 Inveting.com,The Only 2 Ways to Win in Trading,2023-09-19,0.666667,"It doesnt matter if you are Warren Buffett holding positions for decades or Ken Griffith holding them for milliseconds - there are only two ways to trade.In trading you can either go with the price action - or in traders parlance trade flow or go against the price action or fade the move.If you are going to day trade against trend need to know three things - what to trade,when to trade and how much profit to go for.Here is a set up I trade every day in stock index futures. During the European open (around 4 am) stock futures usually make a session high or session low that is fadable for at least 20 points. And even if the trade doesnt work the first time it usually resolves in profit on the second or the third attempt.But trend! Trend is something different altogether. Trend or flow trading has a very specific tell that can give very accurate reads on the market.Here is my proprietary bounce indicator in Flow mode. Notice anything? Flow trades which are bright green tiles on the chart tend to bunch together. Once a flow trade takes shape it tends to be followed by another.So what does that mean to us as retail traders?Simple. We only take a flow trade if the prior trade hit the take profit. If the prior trade was a loss we STOP TRADING until flow turn profitable again. Using this stop and go method we avoid the dreaded churn and increase our chance of winning trades tremendously.So here is the surprising takeaway for day trading. To trade counter trend you need to keep trying until you find the turn in the price action. But to trade trend you need stop and go stop and go until you sync yourself up with the trend move in the market.Thats pretty much the opposite of what most traders do - but now you know!"

Charlie Munger
. ""The whole secret of investment is to find places where it is safe and wise not to diversify,"" Munger once said.For an investor focused on speculative growth stocks,diversification is the name of the game. When the risk associated with any individual stock in your portfolio is high,spreading out your investments is essential. Ideally,the few big winners will more than offset the many losers.An alternative strategy is to avoid highly risky stocks altogether. Instead,identify opportunities where the risk is low and few things need to go right for the stock to do well. That's Munger's investment strategy in a nutshell,and it's mine as well.The top three stocks in my portfolio make up 32% of the total value. The remaining 68% is split between 21 other stocks.

Boeing 737 Max Blowout Points to Pervasive FlawsSaudi Aramco cut the official selling price for its flagship Arab Light crude to a $1.50-a-barrel premium to the regional benchmark for February,the lowest since November 2021. The $2-a-barrel reduction was deeper than foreseen,and follows a weakening of spot differentials for Middle Eastern crudes due to lackluster Chinese appetite and increased global supplies.Oil capped the first annual loss since 2020 last year as non-OPEC+ production expanded,and traders looked ahead to slower growth in demand,including from key importer China. Crudes weakness has prompted Riyadh to make a deep voluntary output cut,as well as complementary reductions from other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.Saudi pricing has been lowered in line with the spot market,which may potentially boost margins for customers that use the kingdoms cargoes as their baseload,refiners and traders said. Aramcos pricing is typically followed by other major producers in the Middle East such as Kuwait and Iraq.Still,at least three Asian customers said the price drop was unlikely to lead to requests for incremental deliveries from the Saudis as there are cheaper,rival supplies still available in the spot market. Two Chinese buyers said they wont be lifting any term cargoes from the Saudis for next month.Last month,Chinese refiners said they would receive less Saudi crude on-month for January loading. Asian crude buyers were also seen turning elsewhere after the kingdom reduced pricing of its key grade by only half the amount forecast.--With assistance from Sarah Chen.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Americas Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs

The two parties reached a settlement on the eve of the trial,one of Haslams representatives confirmed.Although details of the settlement havent yet been made public,the deal is likely to clear the way for Buffett to purchase the remaining 20% of Pilot Travel from Haslam later this month under terms of the original acquisition. The accord means both sides will dismiss all claims against each other,according to Haslams spokesperson.A docket filing in Delaware Chancery Court said the trial,scheduled for Monday in Wilmington before Judge Morgan Zurn,had been cancelled. A lawyer for Buffett didnt immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Haslam,the owner of the NFLs Cleveland Browns,was expected to testify live in the trial,but Buffett was not.The settlement resolves a case that set up a bitter legal battle between the two billionaires. Haslam contends Pilot Travel executives installed by Buffett changed quarterly-earning accounting methods in a way that will cut the value of his holdings by $1.2 billion if the Tennessee-based billionaire choses to sell Buffett his remaining stake.Read More"

Boeing CEOs Comeback Plan for 2024 Takes a Hit Five Days InWould-be Bitcoin ETF issuers have been given until Monday morning in Washington to submit any last-minute revisions to their pending applications,Bloomberg News has reported. The US Securities and Exchange Commission itself has until Jan. 10 to take action on at least one of those applications,and crypto insiders have speculated the regulator will use that date to announce a slew of decisions at once.There are two technical requirements that must be fulfilled before a spot-backed Bitcoin ETF can start trading. First,the SEC must sign off on so-called 19b-4 filings by the exchanges that would list the ETFs. Second,the regulator must approve the relevant S-1 forms,which are the registration applications from the would-be issuers  a list that includes BlackRock and Fidelity.The SEC is planning to vote on the exchanges filings,the 19b-4s,in the coming days,Bloomberg News has reported. The regulator may or may not then take action on the issuers applications,the S-1s,around the same time. If the SEC grants both sets of required approvals,the ETFs could start trading as soon as the next business day.An SEC representative declined to comment on the status of the applications.ETF ImpactBitcoins boosters say ETFs backed by the largest crypto token would represent a watershed moment for digital assets. Billions of dollars are at stake,representing potential inflows from retail and institutional investors alike.The market is still seriously underestimating the potential impact of a Bitcoin ETF approval,said Michael Anderson,co-founder of crypto venture firm Framework Ventures.Story continuesBut the SEC under the Democrat Gary Gensler and his Trump-era predecessor Jay Clayton has previously refused to allow such a product to launch,citing concerns about investor protection and the potential for market manipulation.However,speculation has been mounting since August,when the SEC lost a key legal fight against crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments,that the regulator will have to acquiesce to the growing clamor for the product.Market wagers that regulatory approval is on the horizon fueled a jump of approximately 160% in Bitcoin last year. That still wasnt enough to re-attain the record highs set in November 2021,when Bitcoin hit almost $69,000.The token has stayed in a relatively tight range around $44,000 since the start of 2024.

Boeing 737 Max Blowout Points to Pervasive FlawsThe dynamic was on display Friday,when bond prices dipped after the Labor Department reported that job growth unexpectedly accelerated last month. But the selloff was curtailed because buyers swooped in as 10-year Treasury yields neared 4.1%,the highest since mid-December.The rebound  even in the face of data showing continued strength in the economy  highlighted the stark shift in sentiment over the past two months,with investors increasingly confident that the bond market is firmly recovering from its worst downturn in decades. Despite the recent backup,yields are still well below Octobers peaks as traders wager that the Fed may start easing monetary policy as soon as March.Anything between 4% and 4.2% is a buy for the 10-year,said Priya Misra,portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management,noting that the yield was at the upper end of that range ahead of the last Fed meeting. For 4.2% to break,we have to bring hikes back in or take out overall cuts.The rally that gripped the bond market during the last two months of 2023 put an end to what had been the worst losses in decades,driving Treasuries to a gain for the year and bolstering conviction that yields wont retest the previous peaks. While investors are mindful that yields may drift higher if incoming data alters expectations about the Feds likely path,some big investment firms have been looking at recent drops as good times to buy.Australian and New Zealand yields moved higher on Monday,though the moves were in line with those seen for Treasuries on Friday. The yield on Australian 10-year notes added four basis points to 4.17%,after similar-dated US rates climbed five basis points to 4.05% at the end of last week. New Zealand 10-year yields rose six basis points to 4.61%. Cash Treasuries are shut in Asian hours Monday because Japan is on holiday.Story continuesStrategists at TD Securities told clients Friday that while bonds could still slide further in the near-term they remained convinced the labor market is cooling and the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2024 at 3%.The bond market is not ready to give up on their optimistic assessment for Fed rate cuts this year,said Kevin Flanagan,head of fixed-income strategy at WisdomTree. A narrative of buying on the dips will remain,and it will take more than one jobs report to change that.Not all segments of the bond market are seen as sheltered from losses,with policy-sensitive two-year bonds potentially at risk to repricing if traders dial back rate-cut bets further due to the strength of the economy. And the market is facing further tests this week,with the release of the December consumer-price index reading and a $37 billion 10-year Treasury auction that will provide a key gauge of demand. Theres also focus on a public appearance by New York Fed President John Williams,who has been among officials recently pushing back on market expectations for steep rate reductions early this year.But the Fed has held policy steady since July,and the December meeting minutes released Wednesday showed that policymakers anticipated that they would likely begin easing this year.Read More"
Yahoo Finance ,Analysis-Unloved healthcare stocks draw investors despite US election risks,2024-01-08,0.555556,"By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. healthcare sector is showing signs of life after lagging in 2023 as investors bet cheap valuations will offset a tendency to underperform during presidential election years.The S&P 500 healthcare sector has climbed about 6% since the start of December,doubling the gain of the broader index during that period. Its performance during 2023 overall was far less impressive,as it rose just 0.3% compared to the S&P 500s 24% jump.Healthcare,which has a roughly 13% weight in the S&P 500,was one of the areas left behind last year as investors flocked to the narrow group of massive tech and growth stocks that propelled indexes higher.The rise of new obesity treatments sparked worries that there would be less need for medical treatments aimed at weight-related health conditions at the same time demand for COVID-19 products waned.The sector's lackluster showing has made it an attractive target for investors looking for undervalued areas of the market. The healthcare sector trades at 17.9 times forward earnings estimates versus a P/E ratio of 19.7 for the S&P 500,a discount of 9%. Historically,healthcare has traded at a 4% premium to the broader index,data from LSEG Datastream showed.Investors are starting to look out for those sectors that didnt work in 2023,and healthcare fits that bill,said Art Hogan,chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth,who is recommending investors ""overweight"" the healthcare sector.Some investors are also betting that the rally that boosted tech and growth stocks will spread to other areas - a phenomenon that appears to have started late last year as banks,small caps and other unloved areas of the market drew heavy buying.Earnings are another potential bright spot,with companies in healthcare expected to increase profits by 17.5% in 2024,versus an 11.1% rise for the S&P 500 overall,according to LSEG data.Last year was a very narrow market and I think that broadens out in 2024 and creates opportunities for lots of different stocks to perform better,including healthcare stocks,said Michael Smith,senior portfolio manager for Allspring Global's Discovery Large Cap Growth Fund,which owns shares of UnitedHealth Group,Intuitive Surgical and Veeva Systems.Story continuesThe discount is more acute in certain areas of healthcare.Excluding Eli Lilly,whose shares soared last year on enthusiasm over the potential of its weight-loss treatment,a group of large-cap drugmakers and biotech companies tracked by JPMorgan were trading at a 30% discount to the S&P 500,a ""historically low"" level,the bank's analysts said in a note late last month.Patrick Kaser,a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global,said the firm's value-stock funds are significantly overweight the sector,including holdings in CVS Health,Bristol Myers Squibb and Viatris.Classically,value investors are looking for a group that is out of favor with low valuations,"" Kaser said. ""Healthcare checks both those boxes really well right now.REASONS FOR CAUTIONAn early test for the sector comes at this week's JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco,where investors are gathering to hear dozens of companies forecast the year ahead and talk about their prospects.There are reasons for caution regarding healthcares performance in 2024.The widely expected scenario of a stable but slowing economy,ebbing inflation and falling interest rates could give investors little reason to abandon the big tech and growth stocks that worked for them last year. Those same factors could also be more favorable to sectors that are more tightly linked to the economy,such as financials and industrials.Healthcare stocks also tend to struggle in presidential election years,as the cost of medical care frequently emerges as a political issue that puts the industry in the crosshairs. The sector has only beaten the S&P 500 in three of the past 12 presidential election years,according to Strategas.However,some investors believe this year's presidential contest poses less risk to healthcare stocks than recent past elections.Neither political party is expected to gain significant majorities in Congress,diminishing the chances of major legislation that overhauls the industry,while President Joe Biden already enacted legislation during his first term that addresses drug prices.Generally,healthcare is ""an easy target for politicians,"" said Kaser.This year,""I dont think there is a likely outcome of anything big and new hitting the sector...

The entry said it was authorized by Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn,the judge.The Haslam family,Berkshire Hathaway and the chambers for Zurn could not be reached for comment.The two-day non-jury trial in Delaware's Court of Chancery was meant to determine the value of the Haslam family's 20% stake in Pilot Travel Centers,the largest U.S. truck stop chain.It was expected to feature testimony from Buffett's designated successor,Greg Abel.The Haslams,including Cleveland Browns football team owner Jimmy Haslam,sold Berkshire 80% of Pilot for $11 billion in two separate deals,in 2017 and January 2023.They also have a put option,allowing them to sell the remaining 20% in the first two months of any year.Pilot,which also operates under the Flying J brand,has about 650 locations and sold 13 billion gallons of fuel in 2022.Each side has accused the other of accounting tricks to manipulate the Knoxville,Tennessee-based company's earnings before interest and taxes,or EBIT,which determines the value of the Haslam's 20% stake.According to the Haslams,after Berkshire obtained the 80% Pilot stake it adopted ""pushdown accounting"" that would reduce how much it would owe if the put option were exercised.A lawyer for Berkshire said in court that depending on which side's accounting was used,EBIT would differ by $1.2 billion.The trial outcome would have turned on a simple question"

dropped towards 2,025 after the release of higher-than-expected NFP figures. However, the pair rose after ISM Services PMI numbers appeared lower than the forecast, reaching 2,064. Friday's data revealed that 216,000 new jobs were added in December, exceeding the forecast of 170,000. Thus, the data indicates the labor market's robustness even under tight financial conditions.

However, recent comments from Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda caused speculation about Japan potentially moving away from its negative interest rate monetary policy. Last month, Ueda mentioned an increasing probability that Japan is leaving a period of low inflation and reaching its price stability goal.

Yahoo Finance,I'm Almost 60 and Have $1 Million in My IRA. Should I Switch to Roth Contributions?,2024-01-08,0.666667,"A 60-year-old man considers whether to contribute to a Roth IRA instead of a traditional IRA.Should you switch from pre-tax IRA contributions to Roth contributions?Imagine that youre steadily contributing to a
traditional IRA
. This provides you with an annual tax deduction. However, contributing to a tax-deferred account comes at the cost of having to pay taxes on all of the money you withdraw in retirement. Switching to a
Roth IRA
would reverse this dynamic, leaving you with less capital after paying taxes upfront in exchange for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals.As with all tax questions, the right decision will depend on your circumstances. The answer here may be to speak with a professional to determine what you should do. But in the meantime, here are a few things to think about.(And if you need help finding a financial advisor, consider using this
free matching tool
to connect with one.)Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRAA traditional IRA is what's called a pre-tax or tax-deferred account. You don't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it. However, youll owe
income tax
on the full balance  your original investment plus any gains.A Roth IRA is an after-tax account. You don't get a tax deduction for your contributions but you typically pay no taxes on the money when you withdraw it. That means your money grows tax-free. A bonus of Roth IRAs is that they arent subject to
required minimum distributions
(RMDs), which can increase your tax bill in retirement. (Remember, a
financial advisor
can potentially help you navigate RMDs and build a plan for limiting your tax liability in retirement.)Both types of IRAs have the same
annual contribution limits
. In tax year 2024, you can contribute up to $7,000 to your IRAs, plus an additional $1,000 if youre 50 or older. For tax year 2023, the IRS limits contributions to $6,500, plus the extra $1,000 if youre 50 or older.Opportunity Cost"

Yahoo Finance,The Federal Reserve Signals Interest Rate Cuts in 2024. History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.,2024-01-08,0.666667,"The Federal Reserve is charged with promoting maximum employment and price stability. To achieve those goals, it uses certain monetary policy tools to push the federal funds rate higher or lower. For context, the federal funds rate is a benchmark interest rate that influences other rates across the economy, including credit cards, personal loans, and mortgages.Ultimately, raising interest rates reduces spending and employment, which slows economic growth and brings inflation down. Conversely, lowering interest rates promotes spending and hiring, which accelerates economic growth and allows inflation to drift upward. The Federal Reserve, therefore, adjusts the federal funds target rate based on its monetary policy goals at any given time.In March 2022, officials began raising the benchmark rate to cool fierce inflation brought on by stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. The benchmark rate has since increased at its fastest pace in four decades, meaning credit conditions have tightened incredibly quickly. That dynamic is shown in the chart below.Image source"

Investing.com,The Reckoning in Pension Funds Draws Closer,2024-01-08,0.333333,"By Clint Siegner, Money Metals Exchange
The outlook for pension systems is growing increasingly dire. Promises made to retirees have been generous and they can only be kept if prices for all kinds of assets move consistently higher.
The trouble is that the past three years dont look like the first twenty years of the century.
The 40-year bull market in bonds ended. Commercial real estate is in deep trouble. And there are many indications that a recession is coming, which should translate to lower stock prices.
Now some large pension programs are looking to borrow money to meet their obligations. The union-boss-controlled California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) announced plans to borrow $30 billion in an effort to avoid selling distressed real estate and bonds.
They dont have much choice. Cutting retirement benefits is forbidden by law.
For some systems in certain locales, such as the government employee pensions in Illinois, changing the law means amending the states constitution -- a political impossibility.
The CalSTRS move to borrow roughly 10% of its total asset value smells of desperation. It is a gamble which pays off if there is a big recovery in commercial real estate and bond prices.
The outlook for commercial real estate remains gloomy. The retail sector has struggled for years due to the ongoing transition from brick-and-mortar to online shopping.
More recently demand for office space has been in decline. Work from home was a trend prior to COVID, and it massively accelerated during the pandemic.
The most likely scenario for a recovery in bond prices involves a decline in stock prices.
The Fed isnt likely to start dropping interest rates until stock market weakness signals recession or even worse economic malaise.
If markets fall, it will only get harder and more expensive for pensions to borrow next time.
The alternatives to borrowing will be a fire sale of assets, or a bailout from either the state or federal government.
Given that California is facing a record $68 billion deficit and federal deficits are also skyrocketing, bailouts could be a difficult sell. Liberal California state politicians will likely want to rescue pensions, but they will have to borrow to do it. The states creditworthiness could be an issue.
At the federal level, a bailout to maintain lavish retirement benefits for teachers in California is going to be a hard sell among representatives from more conservative states.
Overextended pension systems managed to stay afloat when prices for equity, real estate and bonds all moved higher. The promises made to retirees assumed a mostly uninterrupted bull market in financial assets.
Few state pension systems allocate any of their assets to physical precious metals in order to protect retirees from inflation and credit risk. One notable exception is the Ohio Police and Firefighters Pension Fund which reported acquired a physical
gold
holding.
Now pension systems that are hitched entirely to financial assets must navigate potential bear markets and tighter borrowing conditions. Many of them may not succeed."
Investing.com,Jobs,2024-01-08,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Every month, we get a strong non-farm payroll report with a big headline number. Every month the market reacts with a stock market drop, a spike in dollar strength, and a selloff in
gold
, all in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will respond to the strong labor market by leaving interest rates higher for longer.
And every month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revises previous months' job numbers lower.
Thats the part nobody pays attention to.
For December, the BLS reported 216,000 new jobs. This was far higher than the 170,000 new jobs projected and resulted in the aforementioned knee-jerk reaction from the markets.
And then there were the revisions.
The BLS revised the November jobs number down to 173,000. It was originally reported as 199,000 new jobs. At the time, this was reported as slightly better than the 190,000 Dow Jones estimate. But we now know the real number was a big miss. It wasn't ""slightly better"" than the estimate. It was ""way worse.""
The BLS also revised Octobers number down to 105,000 new jobs created. The BLS originally reported 150,000 new jobs created in October.
Thats 71,000 jobs that just poof disappeared with no fanfare.
And this isnt an anomaly.
The BLS revised 10 of the last 11 non-farm payroll reports lower.
Notice the pattern.
By the way, the fantastic December jobs report wasnt that great when you dig into the numbers. A big chunk of those new jobs were government jobs (52,000). There was a record 1.5 million crash in the number of full-time jobs. The labor force participation clicked downward. And we have more and more Americans working multiple jobs trying to make ends meet. (Every time some guy starts delivering pizzas at night on top of his day job to keep up with rising prices, that counts as a new job.)
But thats not even the point.
Even if we take the BLS numbers at face value and cheer because the economy created more jobs than projected, history tells us that the agency will revise those numbers down next month, and theres a pretty darn good chance that December's beat will turn into a miss.
And nobody will notice.
The markets only react to the initial numbers. You never see a gold rally because the BLS erased a bunch of jobs from the economy with a few clicks of its calculator. The revisions happen quietly in the back alleys. Nobody pays any attention to them. That creates the illusion that the labor market is much stronger than it actually is.
So, why should we trust any of these numbers, much less make decisions based on them?
And notice that the revisions are always down. If the BLS was making honest mistakes month after month, you would think sometimes they would underestimate the number of jobs created. But they always overestimate the numbers. If you flipped a coin and it came up heads 10 out of 11 times, youd start to wonder about the integrity of that coin, wouldnt you?
Again, its important to wrap your head around the pattern here.
This month, the government reports good news. Everybody celebrates. Markets move. The following month, the government quietly revises everything downward and reports that the good news was really bad news.
And nobody pays attention.
It might be a good idea to pay attention -- to the revisions too. Things arent nearly as rosy as the headlines would indicate."

The business is still based in the small city where Coates was born, but raked in 3.39 billion ($4.3 billion) in 2023.According to its latest accounts, seen by

Yahoo Finance,Ask an Advisor,2024-01-08,0.666667,"Financial advisor and columnist Brandon RenfroI'm 55 and would like to retire now with a $3 million total net worth. I'm assuming my net worth will grow, on average, 5% until Im eligible for Social Security. My house is paid off and my lifestyle is simple. I can live with $5,000 per month. Am I making the right decisions? PeterAt first blush, supporting $5,000 in monthly living expenses on $3 million seems like an easy feat. But I like to start by thinking about scenarios like this in terms of your
distribution rate
 the percentage of your money you'll be withdrawing each year. Withdrawing $60,000 per year would equate to just a 2% annual withdrawal rate, which is incredibly low by pretty much anyones standards. That would put you at very little risk of running out of money.However, since you say ""
net worth
"" instead of nest egg or savings, I would encourage you to take a hard look at how your net worth is composed. Are your assets mostly liquid, like stocks and cash? Or is your net worth primarily tied up in illiquid assets, such as real estate? The answer may dictate how much you can afford to withdraw. (And if you need more help determining when you can retire,
consider speaking with a financial advisor
.)Examining Your Net WorthYour net worth is the value of all of your assets minus any debts. For example, if you own a property that's worth $500,000 and have a $300,000
mortgage
, it contributes $200,000 to your net worth. Of course, your investments, cash and other savings all contribute to your net worth as well.I mention this because the way your $3 million net worth is spread across different types of assets can affect how capable you are of supporting yourself with it. All assets don't provide the same level of flexibility.To illustrate my point, consider this hypothetical scenario"

What Can I Do With It?",2024-01-08,0.666667,"While many retirement accounts offer tax-sheltered ways to save and invest, the IRS mandates accountholders start withdrawing money at a certain point. This takes the form of required minimum distributions (RMDs).
Required minimum distributions
currently start at age 73 for many retirement accounts.Its not uncommon to reach an age when the IRS requires you to start withdrawing money from retirement accounts that you dont need to tap just yet. RMDs can trigger taxes and likely wont generate a competitive return in your checking account. Instead, here are some ways to think about managing this money.If youre looking to build a tax-efficient plan for retirement,
talk to a financial advisor today.Why Plan for RMDs?Required minimum distributions, or RMDs, are withdrawals that the IRS requires you to make from most tax-advantaged retirement accounts. They apply to all pre-tax accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k)s. They do not apply to
Roth IRAs
and, effective 2024, will no longer apply to
Roth 401(k)s
.Starting at age 73,
everyone
with a qualifying account must take this minimum withdrawal each year.This rule applies per-account, not per-taxpayer. So, say you have both an IRA and a 401(k), then each account will have its own minimum annual withdrawal. The
IRS calculates
your minimum withdrawals
based on
your age and the accounts value.For example, say that you turned 73 this year and have $500,000 in an IRA. The IRS
would
require you to withdraw at least $18,867 from this IRA by the end of 2023.With a $1 million retirement account, an annual minimum withdrawal of $37,735 would be required.These are the rules for retirement accounts that you contributed to. Inherited retirement accounts also have required minimum distributions for heirs who receive them. Often you must withdraw this money within 10 years of inheriting it, but
the specifics
vary widely based on the nature of the account and its original owner.Remember, a
financial advisor
can help you determine the best way to structure your withdrawals.Story continuesWhat Can You Do With Your RMDs?At age 73 you can realistically have decades ahead of you, so dont just take out this cash and put it into a depository account. A few ways you can make the money work for you include"

(AP)  Following the settlement of a lawsuit pitting Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam against fellow billionaire Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway, the clock is ticking for the Haslam family to decide whether to sell its remaining stake in the Pilot truck stop chain to Berkshire.Attorneys told a Delaware judge last week that they were prepared for a two-day trial starting Monday in a high-stakes dispute over accounting practices at Pilot Travel Centers LLC. Late Saturday, however, the judge entered an order indicating that the trial had been canceled.On Sunday, Haslams Pilot Corp. announced that the case, including Berkshires counterclaims against Pilot Corp., had been fully settled. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.With the dispute resolved, the Haslams must now decide whether to sell their remaining 20% stake in Pilot Travel Centers to Berkshire in line with a 2017 business deal. PTC, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee, is a diversified fuel company that operates more than 650 travel centers, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, in 43 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces.A spokeswoman for Pilot Corp. declined to comment Monday on whether the Haslam family, which includes former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, will sell its remaining stake in PTC to Berkshire. A spokeswoman for Berkshire did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Berkshire purchased an initial 38.6% stake in PTC in 2017 for $2.76 billion. The two sides agreed at that time that Berkshire would take control of PTC by acquiring an additional 41.4% interest in January 2023. The price tag for that control purchase was roughly $8.2 billion.The 2017 agreements also gave Pilot Corp. an annual 60-day opportunity, beginning Jan. 1 this year, to sell its remaining 20% interest in PTC to Berkshire. The sale price would be calculated using PTCs earnings in the prior year.With the first sale deadline approaching, however, the two sides accused each other of trying to manipulate the companys financial records in order to affect the price Berkshire would have to pay for the Haslam familys remaining 20% stake in the truck-stop chain.Story continuesIn a Chancery Court complaint, attorneys for Haslam noted that an SEC filing by Berkshire last year listed Pilot Corp.s redeemable noncontrolling interest in PTC at about $3.2 billion. Pilot alleged, however, that after taking control of PTC, Berkshire adopted pushdown accounting, that resulted in the company reporting lower net income. Pilot claimed that a 2017 agreement prevents Berkshire from making such an accounting change without Pilots consent.Berkshire responded with allegations that Haslam
tried to bribe employees
at the Pilot truck stop chain to inflate the companys value in order to increase the amount Berkshire would have to pay.An attorney for Pilot told the Delaware judge last month that federal prosecutors have begun an investigation based on Berkshires bribery allegations."

Investing.com,2 Common Misconceptions About Long-Term Bear Markets,2024-01-09,0.666667,"Much of what is thought and believed about the stock market is based upon fallacy and a lack of understanding, which was easily seen in the comments section of one of my recent articles.It seems that manyinvestors felt quite strongly that a long-term bear market is simply an impossibility.They attempted to outline their reasoning in the comments section of my latest articles. So, I am going to discuss the issues they brought up in a series of articles over the coming weeks.I will be breaking the discussion down into six general topics raised in the comments section.Due to the areas of discussion, I am going to cover, I am going to split this discussion up into three articles, as it would be too long for just one article. These are the topics which willbe covered.Since we are dealing with financial markets, which are non-linear and uncertain environments, I want to make it clear upfront that depression is obviously not a foregone conclusion.Therefore, I will end this series of articles outlining what I will need to see over the coming two years to tell me whether we are indeed heading into a 13-21-year bear market.And, if the market takes the path I lay out over the coming two years, then it will make a long-term bear market a high probability.Until such time, I am going to be taking my cues from the market action week by week and month by month, and will not likely take on an extreme bearish posture until I see strong confirmation in the next year or two.But, I will likely be raising a lot of cash in the coming months.So let's get started.Those who have followed my analysis over the last 13 years know that I have caught most (but not all, as we are not perfect) of the major turns in all the assets I cover.While I only cover the

Investing.com,Stock markets flirt with record highs,2024-01-09,0.444444,
Investing.com,2024 Survey,2024-01-09,0.666667,"During the last week of December, I polled my Twitter followers for their outlook on the markets and the economy for 2024. The results were quite interesting, but before we look forward, we must look back at 2023 for context.Last year was not what the majority of mainstream economists and analysts predicted.Going into last year, expectations for a recession and negative market returns were high. The table below shows some important events and market reactions during the previous year for the
S&P 500
. Each one of those events was expected to disrupt the market.Yet, despite higher Fed funds rates, rising interest rates, bank failures, and fiscal concerns, the market closely followed the seasonal pattern of a pre-election year.The correction during the summer certainly had the bears coming out of hibernation, but the bulls were entirely in charge by year-end. The chart is the combined net bullish sentiment index (professional and retail) compared to the S&P 500 index.So, with the understanding that 2023 defied all previous expectations, what do investors enter 2024 think regarding the market and the economy?With the S&P 500 ending the year 24% higher than where it started, 42% believe 2024 will end lower than the years close of 4769.However, if we split the 4600-5000 band, roughly 50% think the year will be lower. Interestingly, 24% expect returns above the 2024 market consensus of 5200.Of course, for the market to generate those returns, the economy must avoid a recession. When asked that question, 45% of those polled believe there is more than a 50% chance of a recession, with 13.6% at a 100% conviction.Here is the problem with that view. In an economic downturn, the market must reprice earnings for slower economic growth.Therefore, given that 2023 was a year driven by multiple expansions, there is significant room for a repricing of earnings if a recession develops.Given that recent economic data has slowed, the more optimistic view of the market will become more challenging as forward earnings estimates continue to decline.Following that poll question of recession expectations, I asked about real
GDP
growth
(inflation-adjusted).
40.2% of those polled expect the economy to avoid a recession but exhibit growth below 2%. Only 28% expect a recession.Again, given that earnings are derived from economic activity, the problem of current growth estimates will be more challenging to obtain.Such is mainly the case given that earnings growth estimates for 2024 are highly elevated relative to historical norms.With valuations on the rise, as earnings fail to keep pace with price increases, the risk of a repricing event increases if earnings fail to meet current expectations.What could keep earnings under pressure? Such would be a slower economy impacted by higher inflation, unemployment, and interest rates.The 2024 poll became more interesting when explicitly asked about the underlying factors of the economy. For example, more than 68% of those polled believed the
unemployment rate
would rise above 4% this year.Given last Fridays BLS employment reports sharp drop in full-time employment, there is certainly some evidence to suggest economic deterioration is in process.
(We will discuss this in further detail on Friday.)However, if employment is expected to fall, then higher rates of inflation are much less probable.Such is because of the supply/demand relationship that drives employment over time. Therefore, the 65% of respondents who believe inflation will be higher than 3% over the next year will likely be disappointed.Another dichotomy in the survey was interest rates. Most respondents also think interest rates will be higher over the next year.The issue is the high correlation between inflation, interest rates, wages, and economic growth. Such was a point
discussed
previously.While it is not near recessionary levels yet, the data trend is slowing. As noted, with an 87% correlation to economic growth, the slower pace will eventually manifest in lower interest rates and inflation.Given that these polls were taken over a week, the participants in the survey were not the same. Such accounts for the diversity of responses in the poll.While you should not make any assumptions from these polls, the responses were interesting. Overall, most participants are more bearish on the markets and economy for the coming year.This was the case last year, and the markets defied those expectations.However, a critical takeaway is that the economy can not be weaker and have higher inflation and interest rates. If employment is slowing, as it looks like, the real risk is slower economic growth, lower rates, and further disinflation.If such is the case, the current earnings growth expectations this year remain elevated even though they have already been revised lower.Such potentially creates the potential for investor disappointment and a repricing of markets to correspond with reduced valuation assumptions.While we have no idea how 2024 will eventually turn out, the risk is that the markets may defy more bearish expectations again, hoping the Federal Reserve will offset any risk with accommodative actions.Or maybe this is the year the
Bears
get it right.The best we can do is pay attention to the changes in the data, manage risk, and be willing to change our views as needed."

But you won't need aggressive or unrealistic returns, putting you in a comfortable position to enjoy the good life today.Here are a few things to think about, in addition to talking through your plan with a
financial advisor.Plan for Secure, but Steady, Portfolio ReturnsThis portfolio should last you for a long time, said Matt WillerManaging Director of Capital Markets, Partner, at
Phoenix Capital Group Holdings, LLC,
provided you invest it wisely. Fortunately, wisely doesn't have to mean speculatively.""Interest rates [today] allow investors today to comfortably generate 5-6% annual yields with virtually no risk Assuming all the savings are taxable, and not in qualified accounts, this translates to at least $100-120k in annual gross interest income, and post taxes is still beyond sufficient to meet the $6,000 after tax expense requirement,"" said Willer.You can increase this even more by accepting modest risk into your portfolio. A blended portfolio, with a good mix of bonds and stocks, will often return an average 8%  11% return said Willer. This can not only provide a generous retirement income and lifestyle, albeit one that will require some risk-management plans but will give you a hedge against inflation.Talk to a financial advisor
about the best investment strategy for you.Invest and Prepare for Personal InflationHedging inflation should be a major priority, and national inflation and your personal inflation may not always be the same thing.Story continuesThe Federal Reserve sets a benchmark inflation rate of around 2%, typically accepting any number between 2% and 3%. That rate alone will double your costs of living roughly every 30 years. Your personal spending power may erode even faster, said,Vijay Marolia,Managing Partner of
Regal Point Capital
, because of the costs associated with how and where you live.This is
personal inflation,
the idea that the costs you pay for your life and lifestyle may grow more quickly than the national averages.For example, say that you rent an apartment in a popular city. Historically, your housing costs will increase much faster than 2%. If you enjoy travel, then your entertainment costs have surged over the past two years. Meat eaters have seen their grocery bills rise faster than vegetarians, and pedestrians aren't as individually worried about gas prices.All of this can mean that your household's costs might not match the national CPI.For example, said Marolia, assume that you have 5% returns from an income-generating portfolio. After taxes that will leave you with $6,250 per month, meeting your current needs.""Don't get too excited, because what looks like a $250 per month surplus may not remain as such; it's only a 4% margin. If one experiences a personal inflation rate of only 5% than this eats the entire surplus and some. Why? Because at 5% inflation, monthly expenses rise to $6,300 per month, or $50 less than you need,""Marolia said.This isn't a dealbreaker, you still have enough money saved up to manage this risk. Just make sure that you do manage it.A
financial advisor
can help you map out budget projections for your retirement.Early Retirement IssuesPersonal inflation is a particularly important issue for early retirees.The reason to retire at 55 is so that you can enjoy your lifestyle. It would defeat the entire point if you priced yourself out of your standard of living. So make sure that you invest for the kind of growth you will need to stay comfortable, not just barely making it on a fixed budget.Beyond that, it's important to remember that early retirement adds a host of new issues to your retirement planning. Two of the most important are health care and
Social Security
.First, you will need to anticipate health insurance.
Medicare
won't kick in until age 65 and, until then, most people rely on their employer for insurance coverage. By retiring early you will need to buy your own coverage. Unless you currently pay for insurance, this will probably add
about $500
to your anticipated monthly budget.Even once Medicare does kick in, you will still need to budget for
gap
and
long-term care insurance
, so don't count on that extra spending to fall off.Second, make a plan for Social Security. One of the good things about having a well-funded retirement account is that you can delay taking Social Security, which will make those benefits more generous in the long run. Indeed, based on your numbers, collecting Social Security age at 70 can be a significant part of your inflation hedge. Just make sure you include this in your overall plan, because that money won't roll in for another 15 years.Consider
matching with a financial advisor
if you still have questions about the best way to finance your retirement.The Bottom LineAt age 55 with $2 million in the bank, you are well positioned to retire early. Just make sure that you anticipate the complicated issues around early retirement, including long-term inflation hedges and health insurance.Early Retirement TipsIf not every budget and inflation profile was made the same, nor was every retirement destination. Some states are simply cheaper to retire in, more fun to retire in or more comfortable in the long run.
Depending on how flexible you are about location, that can be an important part of your retirement plans.

blown out in mid-air
during a Alaska Airlines flight on Friday was the focus of a class-action lawsuit filed less than a month earlier, with the complaint alleging that Spirit AeroSystems had experienced ""sustained quality failures"" in its products.The complaint, filed on December 19 in federal court in New York, was filed on behalf of investors in Spirit AeroSystems, which was originally a manufacturing unit of Boeing until it was spun off in 2005 (The company has no relationship with Spirit Airlines.) According to the suit, Spirit relies heavily on Boeing for orders and manufactures much of the aviation giant's jet fuselages.The midair incident involved a door plug, panels designed to fit into doors that typically aren't needed on an aircraft, transforming them into windows. One of these plugs was sucked out of a
Boeing 737 Max 9
flown by Alaska Airlines just minutes after the plane departed Oregon's Portland International Airport on its way to Ontario, California.Alaska and United Airlines  the only two U.S. carriers to fly the Boeing 737 Max 9  have since said they have found
loose bolts
inside several other door plugs on the jets, which the Federal Aviation Administration has grounded.The lawsuit is noteworthy because of its allegations of manufacturing problems, including a complaint from one Spirit employee who alleged an ""excessive amount of defects"" in an email to one of the company's executives. While none of the issues flagged in the lawsuit specifically involve door plugs, the claim alleges that Spirit's ""quality failures were so severe and persistent that Boeing even placed Spirit on probation for multiple years.""Spirit declined to comment on the litigation. ""Spirit is following the protocols set by the regulatory authorities that guide communication in these types of circumstances, and we will share further information when appropriate,"" the company said a statement.Story continuesBoeing also declined to comment.

Yahoo Finance,Why Apple faces its biggest crisis since it was saved by the iPod,2024-01-09,0.222222,"Apple iPhoneTim Cook did not hold back. This is obviously a disaster, he told finance executives in a 2018 email, ordering his lieutenants to improve underwhelming sales of Apples latest iPhones.Apples business in China was sliding, leading to the companys first profit warning in 16 years. One executive described the performance as an extreme problem, while another said employees needed to respond as if it was a five alarm fire, according to emails recently released as part of a lawsuit against Apple.The company later reported two consecutive quarters of revenue decline, a rare dip for a business famous for reliably getting more cash out of its customers each year.At the time, blame for the poor sales was laid at the foot of
Huawei, the Chinese phone giant
seen as a domestic rival to the iPhone maker.I do think upgraders consider choices [like Huawei] to be more value for money, especially if they dont see major reasons and new innovation in the iPhone, wrote Apples head of marketing for China.Ultimately, Huawei did not kill Apples business in China. US sanctions effectively
crippled Huaweis ability to make high-end handsets
, handing an advantage to the iPhone maker in the process.Despite fraying relations between Beijing and Washington, Apple went on to post record sales in the Middle Kingdom.But Cook may have simply delayed the reckoning. Wall Street has recently sounded a new alarm on Apples business in China, sending the companys shares sliding.It is just one of a number of significant issues facing the worlds biggest company.In November, the company revealed revenues had fallen year-on-year for four consecutive quarters, the longest slump for more than two decades. Some analysts believe Apple could deliver a fifth quarter of decline when it reports Christmas sales in the coming weeks.This would mark its longest losing streak since 1998, the year after Steve Jobs returned to save the company from near-bankruptcy.Story continuesNobody is suggesting that Apple or Cook are in similar trouble. The company became the first business to hit a $3 trillion (2.4 trillion) valuation last year and shares hit a new all-time high just last month.The company has captured more than two thirds of the high-end segment of the smartphone market  the only part that is reliably profitable  and made profits of $97bn in its last financial year"

report will be released at 8"
Investing.com,CPI,2024-01-10,0.333333,"A lot is riding on tomorrows US consumer
inflation report
for December for markets, which are pricing in relatively upbeat news.Quite a lot of the stock markets upbeat profile recently is closely linked to forecasts that the worst has passed for inflation, which leaves room for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates.In that case, the market has a green light to reprice equity prices up, which its been doing to no trivial degree in recent months.Meanwhile, US Treasury yields have fallen recently, largely for the same reason. Tomorrows CPI report will provide a reality check on the rosy assumptions of late.Economists expect a bit of a mixed bag. For the year-over-year headline data, consumer inflation is projected to tick up to 3.2% from 3.1% in November.Thats still well below the recent trend, but the Feds 2% inflation target appears set to remain elusive for the immediate horizon.The sticky headline data will be offset by expectations for softer
core CPI
reading, which strips out food and energy in a bid to estimate a more reliable measure of the trend.This estimate of pricing pressure is on track to ease to 3.8% year-over-year in December. If correct, this crucial measure of inflation will dip below 4% for the first time in nearly three years.Nonetheless, Vanguards senior international economist says that Prices continue to fall at a rapid clip vs. the start of 2023, but Andrew Patterson doesnt expect that the Feds 2% target will arrive until late this year at the earliest.Pattersons outlook aligns with CapitalSpectator.coms econometric forecast for core CPI, based on a proprietary ensemble model. By the end of 2024, this estimate of year-over-year inflation is projected to slide to just over 2%, based on the point forecast.The case for expecting ongoing disinflation also looks persuasive via a set of alternative measures of pricing pressure (for a list, see p. 3 of this sample issue of The US Inflation Trend Chartbook, a companion newsletter for subscribers to The US Business Cycle Risk Report).In the chart below, the sliding trend remains intact and looks set to persist for the near term.For another perspective, consider how the bias compares in the chart above. In the next chart below, theres a clear downside bias for the monthly changes in the year-over-year data points.Although the numbers suggest more progress lies ahead in the battle to tame inflation, the potential for upside surprises can never be ruled out, particularly in the short term.But looking through the noise that could muddy the waters for any given month, the disinflation trend remains on track, even if thats not always obvious for anyone CPI update.Sam Bullard, managing director and chief economist for Wells Fargos corporate and investment banking group"

Accordingly, they have become more frequent and potent market forces.Following economic data, corporate earnings, politics, global affairs, and many other factors are still crucial for investors.Equally important, especially over short periods, is identifying which narrative(s) most heavily impact markets.Todays popular narrative is a growing consensus for the Fed to engineer a soft landing and a Goldilocks economy. Its worth appreciating the Fed and Jerome Powell, purposely or not, started the narrative.As the fiscal stimulus that drove above-average economic growth in the post-pandemic era exits the system and monetary policy remains very tight, economists and investors wonder what comes next.The scenario rapidly gaining in popularity is the Goldilocks narrative.In case you forgot, Goldilocks and The Three Bears start with Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear leaving their house for a walk while their porridge cools.Goldilocks enters their home and tastes the three bowls of porridge.

from December 2022, Kiyosaki emphasized this concept in an interview, saying, If you read Rich Dad, Poor Dad, rich dads lesson No. 1  rich dont work for money. He went on to say, The people that are being screwed today are the poor middle class because they work for money.He said he believes that the rich are adept at navigating economic challenges, seeing them as opportunities to acquire undervalued assets and invest in innovation. In contrast, those in poverty often exacerbate their situation by incurring more debt.Kiyosakis philosophy centers around the idea of working to learn, not just to earn.

Getty ImagesThe S&P 500 could jump 10% to a record 5,200 points this year, Jeremy Siegel says.
The ""Wizard of Wharton"" says the Fed's willingness to cut rates is more important than doing so.
Siegel warns that a flurry of cuts might signal a recession that could pull down stocks.The S&P 500 could surge by 10% to a record high of 5,200 points this year  and plunging interest rates could spell trouble for stocks, Jeremy Siegel says.The retired finance professor known as the ""Wizard of Wharton"" said the US economy is growing at a ""Goldilocks pace"" in his
WisdomTree commentary
this week. It's not expanding quickly enough to scare the Federal Reserve into cooling it down, but it's still strong enough to fuel growth in corporate earnings and shore up stocks, he said.""If real economic growth stays strong, the Fed could keep rates exactly where they are, and we could have strong equity markets,"" he said. The rosy economic backdrop could underpin an 8% to 10% rise in the S&P 500 this year, and push smaller-cap value stocks up 15% given their depressed valuations, he added.The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate from nearly zero to north of 5% since early 2022, in an effort to wrestle historic inflation back to its 2% target. Steeper borrowing costs can temper price growth by discouraging spending, investing, and hiring, but they can also sap demand so much that the economy shrinks and a recession takes hold.Siegel disagreed with the idea that the Fed needs to slash rates aggressively this year for stocks to perform well. The key thing is that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled he's ready to reverse some of the central bank's hikes if the economy weakens, he said.""That willingness to cut is more important than having the cut,"" he
told CNBC
on Monday. ""Honestly, I would love the economy to keep on chugging along, and if it chugs along at 5% fed funds, that's not bad for stocks.""Story continuesThe author of ""Stocks for the Long Run"" said he expected the Fed to lower rates as inflation cools further  a prospect he hailed as ""a real positive for the market going forward."" Yet he noted that a flurry of cuts could indicate a sharp economic slowdown that spooks consumers and investors and hits company earnings.""One has to realize big rate cuts might mean a real slowdown and recession,"" he said. ""Well, the stock market doesn't want that.""Siegel
has been bullish on stock and the economy for a while
. In December, he suggested that house prices could rise by 5% to 10% this year, inflation might slow to around 2.5%, the risk of recession was below 50%, and the Fed might cut rates by five or six times to below 4%.Read the original article on

Yahoo Finance,Do I really need supplemental insurance (Medigap) with Medicare?,2024-01-09,0.333333,"About 41% of Original Medicare beneficiaries had
Medicare Supplement Insurance
, or Medigap, in 2021, according to a February 2023 report summarizing enrollment data from AHIP, a national health insurance trade association. For the other 59%, Medicare has some gaps that could be costly.There are many gaps in Medicare that a beneficiary has to pay if they dont have a Medigap, Kelli Jo Greiner, Minnesota State Health Insurance Assistance Program director, said in an email. This can add up to be thousands of dollars per year.While its not mandatory, you might want to purchase a Medigap policy to fill some of the gaps in Medicare Part A and/or Part B. (Medigap doesnt work with Medicare Advantage policies.)DEDUCTIBLESMedicare Part A has a deductible of $1,632 in 2024, which you owe before Medicare starts to pay for inpatient hospital care.Just one hospital stay, youre going to be paying that $1,632 deductible  so, really fast, your costs can add up, says Joanne Giardini-Russell, CEO of Giardini Medicare, an independent insurance agency.Most Medigap plans cover the Part A deductible. And plans with premiums below $136 per month could put you ahead based on that benefit alone.(New Medicare members cant buy Medigap plans that cover Part Bs relatively smaller deductible of $240 in 2024, so youd still owe that amount out of pocket.)COINSURANCE AND COPAYSAfter youve met your deductible, there are out-of-pocket costs for many Medicare services. For example, you pay a 20% coinsurance for most medically necessary outpatient services covered by Part B.Medicare Part A copays kick in after your 60th day in the hospital. They start at $408 per day in 2024 and get more expensive for longer stays.All Medigap policies include at least some coverage for Part A and Part B coinsurance and copays. If you use a lot of health care, that coverage could mean big out-of-pocket savings.OUT-OF-POCKET LIMITSUnlike many other kinds of insurance, Medicare Part A and Part B dont have maximum out-of-pocket caps. Theres no limit on what you could owe as copays and coinsurance add up.Story continuesOriginal Medicare without Medigap would be perilous because we need Medigap for the out-of-pocket limit, Michael Dayoub, a certified financial planner in Savannah, Georgia, said in an email.Buying a Medigap policy is one way to put a cap on your yearly costs. Paying more upfront for premiums could pay off by limiting your future out-of-pocket spending.IS MEDIGAP WORTH THE COST?You can expect to pay $100-$150 per month or more for the most popular Medigap plan, Plan G, when you sign up at age 65. And premiums can go up based on plan type, age, location and sometimes health status.Thats a significant added expense  so is it worth it?Giardini-Russell compares Medigap to car insurance, which you pay for each month, even though you hope not to need it. It comes down a lot of times to the psychology and peace of mind, she says. Are you willing to pay $150 per month for peace of mind?We tend to hear from beneficiaries that they are very satisfied with their policy, Greiner said. Medigap is worth it if you can afford to pay the Medigap premiums along with your premiums for Medicare Part B and a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, according to Greiner.If Medigap isnt affordable, you might want to look into programs that can help with Medicare costs, such as Medicare Savings Programs and Extra Help subsidies.People who cant afford Medigap premiums could also consider Medicare Advantage, according to Dayoub. Medicare Advantage plans are bundled alternatives to Original Medicare sold by private insurance companies. They have out-of-pocket limits, but there are trade-offs to consider, such as limited provider networks.ENROLLMENT TIME LIMITSThe best and easiest time to buy a Medigap policy is right as youre turning 65. Your six-month Medigap open enrollment period starts when youre 65 and enrolled in Medicare Part B.During this period, insurance companies cant use medical underwriting to charge you more or deny coverage based on your health or medical history. After that, it can be more expensive or even impossible to get a Medigap policy.So if you want to buy in for peace of mind, dont miss your best chance. You can compare options on Medicare.gov, shop online or work with an agent or broker to find the best policy for you.______________________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

Chinese Billionaire Is Second-Biggest Foreign Owner of US LandLithium  the ultra-light metal used in electric-vehicle batteries  has plunged more than 80% from a late-2022 record, as the market whiplashed from shortage fears to a mountain of surplus inventories. Nickel and cobalt have also tumbled, weighed down by an influx of new production amid concerns that the shift to EVs may not be as smooth and quick as predicted.Its a dramatic reversal from the ebullience of recent years that sent prices soaring and sparked a rush by some of the auto industrys biggest players to secure future supply. Now, carmakers are getting cold feet and abandoning deal discussions, according to mining investment bankers and industry executives. The low prices are making it harder for mine builders to raise money from more traditional sources as well, at a time when the industry is also grappling with rampant inflation driving up the cost to build new projects.Chemaf Resources Ltd. last year put itself up for sale after a slump in the cobalt price left it struggling to finish key projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and London-based Horizonte Minerals Plc scaled back work on its Brazilian nickel mine as it searches for funds to complete construction, and announced an emergency $20 million financing late last year.Junior producers have been particularly hard hit. Australias Core Lithium Ltd. said last week it would halt mining operations at its Grants open pit mine until conditions improve, warning of a writedown, while nickel miner Panoramic Resources Ltd. is suspending its flagship mine after entering voluntary administration late last year when it failed to find a buyer or partner.Story continuesThe turmoil is likely to have long-term ramifications for supply, and stands in stark contrast to the growing emphasis by governments on securing future access to critical minerals.Building new mines takes years and sometimes decades, and stalled projects can often be hard to restart. And while most crucial battery markets are now in surplus, shortages are already forecast toward the end of the decade as the greening of the economy accelerates.In the case of lithium  a once-tiny commodity market that has been catapulted into the global spotlight due to its vital role in EV batteries  the extreme boom and bust of the last few years shows the difficulties in trying to forecast future supply-demand balances and prices, for both producers and their investors.Theres nothing magical about EV input markets like lithium and cobalt"

Yahoo Finance,"The housing market is heading for the affordability of 2 years ago, Morgan Stanley says. Heres why its home price forecast is unchanged",2024-01-09,0.555556,"Morgan Stanleys home price outlook is unchanged, but it does see something new in affordability, after a painful year for most homebuyers, as mortgage rates bit in a way they havent
since the 1980s
. James Egan, the banks co-head of U.S. securities products research, crunched the data on mortgage rates falling from their recent 8% peak to the 6% range, and sees affordability improving as early as next month to a point unseen since February 2021, which was less than halfway through the pandemic housing boom.This is needed since home prices have once again broken through to a new record high, the note said. Egan and his team cited data showing Octobers year-over-year increase of 4.8%. The catch, they say, is that mortgage rates decreased more than 50 basis points in December and close to 70 basis points the prior month. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is sitting at 6.8%much lower than Octobers 23-year high, but more than double the 3% range that put a floor under the pandemic era housing boom.Mortgage rates will also support Morgan Stanleys forecast from November, which sees prices mildly declining through 2024. While home prices continue to climb, as these lower rates filter through our affordability calculations the pace of deterioration has slowed to its most benign levels since 2Q21, the banks strategists wrote. If rates were to hold at these levels, [year-over-year] affordability could improve as soon as next monthwhich would be the first time this has been the case since February 2021.It is our expectation of increases here that has us continuing to expect a mild decrease in home prices in 2024 despite improved affordability and the growth in sales, the strategists wrote. In late November, the investment bank
forecast
a 3% drop in nationwide home prices through this year.If current mortgage rates were to hold, the strategists added, the monthly mortgage payment on a median-priced home would be $185 lower than Morgan Stanleys existing metric. That would bring the average monthly payment to its lowest level since April. Nonetheless, affordability has already improved some.Story continuesThe bank found that pending home sales and mortgage purchase applications remain soft, but the pace of their decline has moderated significantly, the note read, citing a 15% year-over-year decline in purchase applications and a 5% decline in pending home sales last month. But the investment bank predicts sales to increase this year, with existing-home sales jumping 2.5% year over year, and new-home sales 7.5%.While a faster improvement in affordability than we expected introduces upside risk to our forecastswe expect the absolute levels of affordability and inventory to keep growth from accelerating too quickly, they wrote.Existing-home sales
retreated to their slowest pace in more than a decadelargely a result of the lock-in effect, which refers to homeowners refusing to sell their homes for fear of losing their low mortgage rates. More than 90% of conventional borrowers have a mortgage rate less than or equal to 6%; nearly 87% have a rate less than or equal to 5%; almost 75% have a rate less than or equal to 4%, according to Morgan Stanley.However, the lock-in effect seems to be showing signs of easing, as existing-home sales rose in November after five consecutive monthly declines. Theyre still down more than 7% on an annual basis, and new-home sales are only up more than 1% year over year. But it is expected that supply will increase this year. For-sale inventory was virtually unchanged, in December, following seven consecutive months of declines. Months of supply, which refers to the number of months it would take for all the current homes for sale on the market to sell, has also increased to its highest level since May 2020, the note said.This story was originally featured on

He pointed out that the ""Magnificent Seven"" technology stocks that led the market's charge last year have ""gone dead sideways"" since July, signaling a shift in momentum.Gundlach underscored that the US stock market hasn't trounced its international rivals in the past couple of years, suggesting it isn't the ""world beater"" it once was. Moreover, he warned the dollar would likely weaken in the next recession, weighing on the S&P's performance relative to emerging-market peers.Story continuesThe bond guru raised the alarm on the US economy too. He said a recession looks highly probable, as the
inverted yield curve
is now de-inverting, leading economic indicators have been
declining for a while
, and employers hanging on to workers has caused a ""backup"" in the unemployment rate that could cause it to ""go vertical"" once the slowdown strikes.Gundlach called out excessive public spending as well. It has caused the national debt to balloon, he said, exacerbating the federal government's headache of debt payments eating up more and more of its revenues due to higher interest rates.""We're going to have a problem here,"" he said. ""This will get much worse when the recession comes.""Gundlach concluded with a gloomy outlook for markets and the economy.""I think 2024 will be a year of high volatility"
Yahoo Finance,The SEC just approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Here's what investors should know.,2024-01-10,0.555556,"The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday granted approval to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, backed by Wall Street, a key regulatory step expected to drive significant investment in the digital currency.The agency gave the green light to multiple financial firms to offer spot bitcoin ETFs, including asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Franklin Templeton that cater to retail investors. Until now, only bitcoin futures ETFs had SEC approval. Bitcoin prices have shot up on the SEC's approval of the ETFs, more than doubling since last year, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index
shows.
Prices for the cryptocurrency had already risen 61% since October on expectations that the SEC planned to grant approval of spot ETF applications, CoinDesk
reported.Here's what to know about spot bitcoin ETFs.What's an ETF?ETFs are pooled investments, like a mutual fund, but that trade on stock exchanges like a stock or bond and that track a specific index, sector or asset class.A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF. Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency
exchange

Yahoo Finance,SEC ends crypto drama by giving the green light to 11 bitcoin ETFs,2024-01-10,0.222222,"The moment the crypto world wanted finally happened Wednesday. And this time it was for real.Regulators on Wednesday gave money managers the green light to launch 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, allowing everyday investors to get exposure to the worlds largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.The ETFs, which begin trading Thursday, could make bitcoin a potential staple in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans and give it mainstream acceptance.The Securities and Exchange Commission made the announcement roughly 24 hours after a fake social media post claimed those approvals had already been granted.The chaos triggered by that unauthorized post on X reverberated from Wall Street to Washington while attracting new scrutiny to the SEC, a longtime foe of the industry that is still in the middle of a widespread crackdown on some of cryptos major players.The price of bitcoin seesawed Tuesday and Wednesday as investors tried to make sense of the mishap, which erased tens of billions in market value in just minutes.SEC Chair Gary Gensler made it clear in a statement Wednesday that his agency ""did not approve or endorse bitcoin"" when it signed off on the new products and called Wednesday's announcement ""the most sustainable path forward"" following a key court defeat on this issue last summer.""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,"" he said in his statement.Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. (Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS)
(REUTERS / Reuters)One SEC commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw, published a dissenting opinion that called the agency's actions ""unsound and ahistorical.""""I am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of US households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets,"" she said in her statement.The SEC has rejected such applications in the past, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation.Story continuesThe list of applicants approved by the SEC Wednesday included some of the biggest names on Wall Street, from BlackRock (
BLK
) to Franklin Templeton (
BEN
), as well as a number of firms better known in the crypto world.These issuers competed with one another in the run-up to their launches to offer the lowest fees, hoping to attract as many investors as possible once ETFs begin trading.Other big Wall Street players plan to be part of the action, as well. JPMorgan Chase (

(Lucas Jackson/REUTERS)
(REUTERS / Reuters)Since then, the SEC has denied more than 30 similar applications.A key turnaround moment came last year in June when the worlds biggest money manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The interest from one of Wall Streets biggest names sparked other asset managers to follow suit.Another important development came last August when one of the ETF applicants, Grayscale Investments, won a key legal victory over the SEC. Grayscale had sued the SEC in 2022 after it wasn't allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (
GBTC
) into a spot bitcoin offering.Its core argument was that the agency had already approved exchange-traded products that held bitcoin futures contracts and thus had ""acted arbitrarily and capriciously.""A three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington sided with Grayscale, saying the firm had ""advanced substantial evidence"" its product was similar to bitcoin futures ETFs previously approved by the SEC.That forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscales spot bitcoin ETF application, along with others filed by rival money managers.""We are now faced with a new set of filings similar to those we have disapproved in the past,"" Gensler said in his statement Wednesday. ""Circumstances, however, have changed.""One of the applicants, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, told Yahoo Finance that the dominant providers of spot bitcoin ETFs will be those that take in the most money from investors right out of the gate.The winners ""will be a few and it will be the most liquid,"" she said.Cathie Wood, ARK Investment Management's CEO.

(REUTERS / Reuters)Historically, launches for other bitcoin products have sent bitcoins price on a wild ride.It happened in 2017 with the launch of the countrys first bitcoin futures contracts and then in 2021 with the SECs approval of the first bitcoin futures ETFs. Prices soared and then fell by large amounts in the year following the launches.In recent weeks, much debate has raged over whether bitcoin will rise or fall once the lauded moment of approval comes to pass.Gautam Chhugani, managing director of the research arm for Bernstein, said his team estimates such financial products will garner $10 billion or more in investment flows through the end of 2024 and ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" over a two-year period.That, he added, will help push bitcoins price even higher.""We do think that bitcoin goes to $150,000 by 2025,"" Chhugani added.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.Click here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

will pause all hiring in technology and product divisions, including in its chat subsidiary Slack, according to a message from Ross Harmes, chief of staff to the Slack CTO, seen by
Fortune
.""This isn't our first rodeo with hiring pauses, but it's definitely disruptive and will affect our plans in Q1 and beyond,"" Harmes wrote. ""Remember, we won't ask you to do the same amount of work with fewer people, so adjust plans accordingly.""While Salesforce had a hiring freeze last year from October 2022 to January 2023, this hiring freeze doesn't have an anticipated end date, according to the memo. The freeze will be lifted ""based on how the numbers are looking each quarter, I would assume at least a quarter,"" Harmes wrote. All written and verbal offers already out will be honored, the memo added.""Headcount that you currently have isn't going away, it's just being delayed,"" Harmes wrote. ""We'll maintain the list of open roles, and continue to add to it when people leave.""This hiring pause comes after Salesforce went on a hiring spree just a few months ago, hiring 3,300 people across various departments, Bloomberg
reported
. That hiring spree had followed a round of cost cutting in January 2023, when the company
laid off 10% of its staff
after hasty pandemic hiring followed by an economic downturn.""Our job is to grow the company and to continue to achieve great margins,"" Benioff told Bloomberg in an interview at the time. ""We know we have to hire thousands of people.""Layoffs and pauses seem to be making an unfortunate comeback in the new year. The announcement of Salesforce and Slack's hiring pause coincides with significant reductions in
Amazon's Twitch
and
Prime Video divisions
, where there are plans for a 35% reduction in staff and several hundred cuts, respectively. There's also Humane, the AI pin startup which raised over $200 million and plans to ship its new hardware in the coming months, which
laid off 4 percent of employees this week
in a cost-cutting measure.Story continuesThis freeze comes as a surprise to some, especially
after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff extended job offers
to OpenAI employees in November, promising to match their current salaries after the temporary removal of OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman.""The good news is that we've made a ton of hires over the last six months. The bad news is that managers with open roles will feel the pain for a while with understaffed teams,"" Harmes wrote.Got a tip? Contact Kylie securely via encrypted messaging app Signal at
