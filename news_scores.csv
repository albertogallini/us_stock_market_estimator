 Inveting.com,Bank Borrowing From Fed Bailout Program Has Surged,2024-01-05,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Is a U.S. banking crisis still bubbling under the surface?
If activity in the Federal Reserves bank bailout program is any indication,the answer to that question is yes.
Over the last two months,the balance in the Fed Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has surged,and the pace of borrowing appears to be increasing.
Since Nov. 19,the amount of outstanding loans in the BTFP has increased by $27.3 billion. The balance in the bailout program grew by nearly $5.4 billion in just the last week.
As of Jan. 3,the balance in the BTFP stood at just over $141.2 billion. Its the largest balance since the program was created in March.
Borrowing had leveled off in August before the sudden spike in November. Keep in mind that banks were still tapping into the bailout even as the total balance in the program plateaued. Some banks were paying off loans as others borrowed.
This surge in bank bailout borrowing may indicate more banks are struggling in this high interest rate environment,and that the financial crisis that kicked off in March is still bubbling under the surface.The BTFP program is a sweetheart deal for banks struggling to raise short-term capital.

 Inveting.com,National Debt Tops $34 Trillion but so What?,2024-01-04,0.333333,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
On Dec. 29,the national debt slipped above $34 trillion for the first time.
On the date,the debt was $34,001,493,655,565.48,to be exact.
But so what?Despite a few alarming headlines,nobody really seems to care. In fact,NPR did a story highlighting the supposed ""benefits"" of a massive national debt.
The debt continues to increase at a dizzying pace. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5,the national debt stood at $31.46 trillion. Since that time,the Biden administration has added $2.54 trillion to the national debt.
The government is running up the debt at roughly $1 trillion every three months. It eclipsed $32 trillion on June 15 and $33 trillion on September 15.
Since the beginning of 2016,the total debt has spiked by $15 trillion. Thats an 80 percent increase.
It's hard to wrap ones head around $34 trillion. To put things into perspective,every U.S. citizen would have to write a $101,234 check to pay off the debt. Every American taxpayer is on the hook for $264,090.
Or to look at it another way,$34 trillion is more than the total economies of China,Japan,Germany,and the UK combined.
Its a Spending Problem
The Biden administration likes to blame the ballooning debt on Republican tax cuts. But while federal receipts declined last year,they shrank from decade-high levels.
In fact,the government enjoyed a revenue windfall in 2022. According to a Tax Foundation analysis of Congressional Budget Office data,federal tax collections were up 21 percent that year. Tax collections also came in at a multi-decade high of 19.6 percent as a share of GDP. But at the time,CBO analysts warned the good times wouldnt last. And they didnt. Government receipts fell by 9.3 percent in fiscal 2023.
Falling revenues are certainly an issue,but you'll find the real problems on the spending side of the ledger.
On its way to the third-largest budget deficit in U.S. history,the Biden administration spent $6.46 trillion in fiscal 2023. That was an 8.8 percent year-over-year increase in actual spending.
You might think Congress solved this problem with the spending cuts in the debt ceiling deal (aka the [misnamed]
Fiscal Responsibility Act
). But we live in an upside-down world where spending cuts mean spending still goes up.
Even if Congress and the president managed to stick to the plan (and they wont),the so-called spending cuts will not put a dent in actual total spending. That means we can expect massive deficits to continue month after month.
This isnt to let Republicans off the hook. Despite occasionally paying lip service to fiscal responsibility,the GOP also borrows,spends,and runs big budget shortfalls.
To put the deficits into some historical perspective,before the pandemic,the U.S. government had only run budget deficits of over $1 trillion four times  all by the Obama administration in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.The Trump administration almost hit the $1 trillion mark in 2019 and was on pace to run a trillion-dollar deficit in fiscal 2020 prior to the pandemic,even as the U.S. supposedly enjoyed the best economy ever. The economic catastrophe caused by the governments response to COVID-19 gave policymakers an excuse to spend with no questions asked and we saw record deficits in fiscal 2020 and 2021.
Now the Biden administration has settled into the new status quo  running 08 financial crisis-like deficits every single year.
Notably,this relentless increase in debt is happening when the economy is supposedly strong. Typically,a strong
economy
generates more tax revenue,and deficits shrink. But this isnt really a strong economy. It is a house of cards built on debt. Fiscal stimulus is helping to prop it up.So What?
One of the most common responses I get when I talk about the national debt is,So what?
After all,the national debt has been expanding precipitously for years. Nothing has happened.
At least not yet.
But this is clearly an unsustainable trajectory.
This rapid increase in the national debt is happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills.
Interest expense rose by 23 percent to $879 billion in fiscal 2023. Net interest,excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds,rose by 39 percent to $659 billion. Both of those numbers broke records.Looking at Novembers interest expense puts things into a little sharper perspective.
Uncle Sam spent $79.92 billion in interest expense to finance the national debt in November. That was more than national defense ($70 billion) and more than Medicare ($79 billion). The only higher spending category was Social Security.
A lot of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month,some of that super-low-interest paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates.
The weighted average interest rate on the governments $26 trillion of outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.10 percent in November. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.22 percent in November 2022.Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words,the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
The bottom line is interest payments will continue to quickly climb much higher unless rates fall.
This may be one of the reasons the Federal Reserve is so eager to cut interest rates in 2024 despite price inflation being nowhere near the 2 percent target.
If the national debt climbs to $40 trillion and interest rates remain at 5 percent,interest payments on the debt would skyrocket around $2 trillion per year. That means that even if the U.S. government balanced the budget so receipts covered all spending minus interest payments,wed still be facing a $2 trillion annual deficit.
Of course,there wont be a balanced budget. So,lets assume the federal government can maintain the current deficit level of around $1 trillion annually (minus interest expense). Even with this overly optimistic scenario,the Treasury would be running a $3 trillion annual budget deficit. (Thats the current $1 trillion deficit plus $2 trillion in interest expenses.)
And the most likely scenario is spending will continue to climb,along with the budget deficits. Theres no telling how high the annual deficits could run.This is a fiscal powder keg. All it needs is a match.

 Inveting.com,US Dollar Recovers as 2024 Kicks Off,2024-01-03,0.666667,"As we kick off January,it's common to witness some fluctuations in the stock market,primarily driven by portfolio adjustments and profit-taking activities. Many investors and fund managers engage in realigning their portfolios at the start of the year,often opting to realize profits from the previous year. This strategy is typically aimed at deferring tax liabilities,as these gains will be taxed in the new tax year,rather than in 2023.Concurrently,we might observe a rally in the US dollar. This trend is partly influenced by these portfolio adjustments,as investors may temporarily shift towards cash or dollar-denominated assets during this period of rebalancing.
However,it's important to note that these movements are often temporary.The market is likely to stabilize or even reverse these early trends as the month progresses and investment flows normalize. Additionally,today's release of the Federal Reserve minutes will offer more insights into the central bank's latest meetings. While significant changes in policy are not anticipated,the minutes will provide valuable context to their current stance and future outlook,potentially influencing market sentiments.Below you can also check my 2024 Elliott wave video outlook.Grega"
 Inveting.com,What Would It Take to Get a Depression?,2023-12-27,0.222222,"By Peter St. Onge,PhD
So far this year,my base case on the economy has been that we're repeating the 1970's stagflation. With a first bout of high inflation followed by a period of rapid GDP growth that ends in a second,even worse,stagflation.
Going by the 70s,that second stagflation could go on for a long time considering the last one was only ended by a brutal series of engineered recessions that cost Jimmy Carter his job.
In other words,Washington won't make that mistake again  next time they'll just let it run.
All pretty dire,but there's actually another shoe to drop an even worse outcome that  going by commenters  a lot of people are worried about"
 Inveting.com," US Dollar Index Moves Toward Resistance Ahead of CPI,Fed Decision",2023-12-11,0.666667,"We have a busy week with plenty of economic data,which certainly should have an important impact on the markets. One of the most important will be the US inflation report which is expected to come down from 3.2% to 3.1% y/y and then also FED rates decision on Wednesday,so it will be interesting to see if dollar can see new bear trend once more,after some strong US jopbs data last week. I think that as long as jobs data and inflation figures will not show the same picture for the economy,thats how long market can be a bit tricky and choppy on dollar pairs. From an Elliott wave perspective,I see DXY in a corrective a-b-c rally,back in wave four that can be moving into 104.50-105 resistance so technically trend is down,but we need some catalyst for the downtrend to resume.

That said,we may see some pullback that will allow us to be short dollars from better levels. Looking at the Elliott wave structure,I surely would not be surprised to see wave four here,if current hourly trendline support is broken. US yields have five down as well.

CPI
came down more than expected yesterday at 3.2% y/y,and as a result the USD fell sharply with US yeilds,while stocks and metals are on the rise. For now,this seems to be a very important data as it causes also a very important key breakdown on USD index and US yeilds.Looking at the US yeilds,we have five waves down,so it means that top is in place,and suggests that speculators believe that FED is done with hiking. But keep in mind that if energy (crude for example) will turn back up this month then again inflation expectations and rate policy may change and influence investors' moods.So tracking
crude oil
in the next few weeks is crucial. Also,keep in mind that a pullback on US yields can show up soon,and it can force some dollar shorts from yesterday to liquidate. But that's yet to be seen,as I realize that pullbacks may not be that deep after all.But for now,at least the intraday direction is clear and bearish for the DXY,where we may see a continuation to around 103-103.40 where we see 50 and 100 Weekly MA."

 Inveting.com,Stocks Week Ahead,2024-01-08,0.666667,"This week will be another in-focus week,with the
CPI
and
PPI
reports coming toward the weeks end.Additionally,3 Treasury auctions will be front and center as well. This will follow a fairly previous strong week of data,which suggests the US economy is hanging in nicely.Currently,Bloomberg Economics
GDP
Nowcast is forecasting fourth-quarter growth of around 2.3%,which is slower than the roughly 5% third-quarter print but still a respectable growth rate.Coupled with a roughly 3%
inflation
rate,nominal growth is still around 5ish %. Again,it is a health level.Given a 5% nominal growth rate,I think it will be tough to see the Fed cut rates at the moment as aggressively as the market has priced in.As of the third quarter,Nominal GDP y/y growth was still above the Fed Funds rate,and even with a 5% nominal growth in the fourth,the Fed Funds rate and nominal growth would be almost equal.It isnt until the Fed funds rate is 0.5% to 1% higher than nominal growth that downward pressure is exerted on the economy,and the odds for recession seem to increase.So I think,at the bare minimum,the Fed can continue to be patient and see what the data says,and the CPI report this week may or may not help that cause.The median expectation is for an increase of 3.2% in December,while inflation swaps are priced at an increase of 3.32%.If we look back at the data over the last few months when rounding to the nearest 0.1%,swaps have only overestimated CPI 1 time out of the last six times.At the same time,the median has overestimated the actual CPI 3 times.So,if we care about when the CPI has come in hotter than expected,the inflation swaps have had a better run,so one should be mindful of the risk that CPI comes in above the consensus of 3.2% this month.If the swap data turns out to be right,given where GDP growth in nominal terms appears to be,the odds of the Fed cutting rates as aggressively as the market has priced will likely not be supported by the data.Fed Funds policy will need to be held in place for some time longer.The Fed sees rates around 4.65% at the end of 2024,while swaps are trading at 3.78% and Fed Fund Futures are trading at 3.94%. The gap is too wide and will need to be closed.This will likely result in rates across the curve rising further because assuming a 2% inflation rate,with the 5-year trading at 4%,suggests a Fed funds rate of 2%,lower than the Feds longer-run rate of 2.5%.So it would probably suggest a 50 bps upside to the 5-year from current levels and the entire curve.While it doesnt suggest a
10-year
rate moving back to the October higher,it does suggest a 10-year rate perhaps moving back to 4.5 to 4.6%.Given that the 10-year is showing positive and strong momentum from a break out in the relative strength index and a strong break out from a downtrend on the price chart,it wont take much,perhaps more than a close above the 200-day moving average,to get the 10-year moving higher towards 4.25% to 4.3%.Inflation data may only add to the breakout that already appears to be taking place.The
dollar
would also likely get a boost. While the dollar isnt as well positioned as the 10-year currently,It is getting closer to seeing a significant breakout,with an RSI trending higher overall and breaking free in several key spots.If the
DXY
can clear the 102.65 region,it has room to run to around 103.50 and test horizontal resistance and the 200-day moving average.The
S&P 500
is also on its way lower and has recently fallen below its 10-day exponential and 20-day simple moving averages,with the lower Bollinger band around 4,580 being one potential target.Of course,it is not uncommon that when an index hits the upper Bollinger Band,it retraces to the lower Bollinger band over time,and in that case,that would be around 4,100 on the weekly chart.It isnt uncommon on the monthly chart,meaning a revisit to the lows of around 3,600. Because that is what happened in mid-2022,early 2020,late 2018,and in parts of 2016.The December 2023 rally pushed the index above the upper Bollinger band. We are now in 2024,of course. Have you noticed the trend?The market has been very aggressive with rate cuts,and rate cuts to the degree the market has priced doesnt look rightalso,the earnings multiple of the S&P 500 is too high at 19.4.The median PE ratio for a 12-month forward S&P 500 is 16.4; at roughly $242 in earnings per share,the value of the S&P 500 would be around 3,960.That is,assuming that earnings grow by 10%,should they grow by just 5%,and are instead $231 per share,the value drops to 3,790.So,from a fundamental and technical basis,a drop back towards the lower monthly Bollinger band should not be completely ruled out or viewed as fiction.The fundamentals and technical aspects suggest it be possible,especially if rates increase again and earnings dont live up to the hype.Enjoy the final week of Football.

It means Goldilocks must return from her Christmas trip to Aruba and appear this week.For December,the
ISM manufacturing
index is expected to rise to 47.1 from 46.7,while the service index falls to 52.5 from 52.7.
ADP
is expected to show 113,000 new jobs were created in December versus 103,000 in November.Finally,the official BLS job report
predicts
163,000 new jobs will have been made,down from 199,000 in November.Overall,these numbers are consistent with their prior trends and suggest no significant change in economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model indicates that the fourth quarter is growing by a 2.4% seasonally adjusted annualized rate.At least,based on the estimates,there doesnt seem to be enough to support rate cuts any time shortly. If it comes in as expected,I think that data is probably enough to turn higher the recent decline in rates and tighten financial conditions.By most standards,financial conditions have eased so much that the easing could have already substituted for rate cuts.In fact,over the last two months,the GS financial conditions index has reduced by its most ever. One could argue this could have a stimulative effect on the US economy as we move forward.On top of this,we have started to see shipping rates rising,as noted by the WCI Composite Container Freight Benchmark,which has increased from 1381 on November 30 to 1660 on December 21.It will be interesting to see if the recent increase in freight cost shows up in the ISM manufacturing Priced Paid PMI for December.There are no estimates currently,but the index was 49.9 in November. If one thing is clear,higher freight costs and easing financial conditions lead to higher prices over time.If this shows up,then I would think the recent decline in long-term rates will likely reverse; how high rates on the back of the curve go from here is unclear,but there are signs that the
10-year rate
can also go higher from a technical standpoint.The RSI is starting to consolidate and is even showing signs of turning higher. The big test will be when the 10-year reaches the 10-day exponential moving average and if it can breathe above that moving average.If the 10-year does break higher,the downtrend at 4% becomes the next target,and after that,we would be talking about a 10-year moving higher to around 4.35%.Overall,I think this will likely result in the
10/2
curve moving higher,with most of the heavy lifting coming from the back of the curve. It certainly appears like the curve is breaking out of a downtrend.As for the
S&P 500
,higher rates and steeper curves will present problems,especially if it is because we begin to start seeing the effects of easing financial conditions in this weeks data points.The S&P 500 also broke below a rising wedge pattern and is closing in on the 10-day exponential moving average,which hasnt been broken since November 2.That moving average comes at 4,745 and is around the zero gamma level.The zero gamma level is the line that separates positive from negative gamma; a break below the zero gamma level would push the index back into negative gamma and increase volatility. I still think a return to 4,100 over the next several weeks is likely.So,at this point,it seems a lot is riding on the data this week,and to keep the market moving higher,it will take the data coming in just right. Anything too hot or cold will be a big blow to the end-of-year rally.Original Post"

 Inveting.com,Reconsidering the Dovish Fed Expectations,2024-01-08,0.555556,"The New Year unsurprisingly kicked off with a hangover for both stock and bond markets,as investors began the year by closing their positions and taking profit following an impressive two-month rally that was boosted by the expectation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would soon start cutting the interest rates and cut them thoroughly throughout this year. We begin the new year with the expectation that the Fed will cut the rates 5 times,by 25bp each,and the first rate cut will be announced by March,with around 64% probability. Note that this probability was standing somewhere around 80% by the end of last year and its come down,as investors probably realized that the expectations and the market rally went well ahead of themselves. And of course,the minutes from the Feds last meeting,released last week,didnt give any clarity other than the general thinking that the Fed rates are certainly at or near their peak for this cycle,but that there is an unusually elevated degree of uncertainty meaning that the expectation of around 75bp cut this year is certainly not a done deal. And indeed,the strength of the US economy and its jobs market wouldnt justify an imminent start of the Fed cuts this spring.In this context,last weeks jobs data from the US came in stronger than expected,yet again. The US economy added more than 200000 new nonfarm jobs in December,and the average earnings accelerated more than expected,above 4%. Some saw a bit of weakness in the US job metrics pointing at the falling job openings and the falling participation rate,but rationally speaking,an NFP figure above 200K is not pointing at a severe slowdown which would urge the Fed to start cutting the rates in two-and-something month and cut by 150bp to the end of the year. Even Janet Yellen said it  in quite an unusual declaration after Fridays jobs report said that what we are seeing now I think we can describe as soft landing,and again a soft landing doesnt justify a 150bp cut from the Fed this year.As such,there is no surprise that we see the
US 2-year
yield rebound to 4.40% and the 10-year yield return past the 4% - its biggest weekly advance of the
US 10-year
yield since October. The rising yields halted the
dollar
s bleeding. The
EUR/USD
sank below the 1.10 mark as soon as the year started. The rising US yields also stopped the rally in equities. The
S&P 500
dipped below 4700  having been unable to post a fresh record at the end of the latest rally,and the rate-sensitive
Nasdaq 100
fell more than 4% since its December peak  which was an ATH. And because the correlation between the US treasuries and Nasdaq 100 stocks remains high,a further rise in the US yields will likely cause a deeper retreat for the US stocks  and especially the most-loved tech stocks. But note that this correlation will likely decline with the start of the earnings season this week,as the company results will give investors a various range of reasons to buy or sell stocks. Overall,according to FactSet,the estimated yoy earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 1.3% for the Q4. If thats the case,it will mark the second straight quarter of year-over-year earnings growth for the index,and its another evidence that the US economy doesnt need the Feds help to stay afloat.This weeks major economic data is the US inflation data due Thursday. The headline inflation in the US is expected to have slowly accelerated to 3.2% from 3.1% printed a month earlier,while core inflation is expected to have further eased to 3.8% from 4% printed a month earlier. Soft inflation numbers,ideally softer-than-expected,could slow the corrective selloff in both stock and bond markets,yet the inflation risks are now tilted to the upside. Tensions in the Red Sea region explode the price of shipping goods from Asia to Europe and America. The cost of shipping goods from Asia to Europe doubled since last December,and thats a bad indication of whats to come for inflation numbers in the coming months. Remember,the last time we saw the shipping costs surge  that was during the pandemic  had followed a significant rise in a very wide range of consumer prices. Therefore yes,inflation figures in US and Europe have come significantly down last year,but the easing could slow or reverse. And thats the biggest risk to the dovish Fed and European Central Bank (ECB),and Bank of England (BoE) expectations this year.Happily,though,the oil prices continue to see strong resistance despite the Red Sea tensions. The barrel of
US crude
couldnt clear the $74 offers last week and we start the week below the $73pb level. The geopolitical risks prevail,but traders continue to see the tops in an effort to force the price of a barrel of American crude to below $70pb again."

 Inveting.com,Did Markets Get Ahead of Themselves? December Surge Faces Reality Check in January,2024-01-08,0.666667,"Markets rose last month,continuing Novembers rally as interest rates pulled back even more on expectations of Fed rate cuts in 2024. Markets in the U.S. were up by mid-single digits,finishing a solid quarter and a very strong year. International markets were also up substantially for the month,quarter,and year. And while stocks were hot,even fixed income posted enough gains to close out the year in the black. 2023 ended with a bang.Interest rates. The rally was,once again,due mainly to interest rates,which kept dropping in December. Better inflation numbers raised hopes the Fed would start cutting rates this year,and signs of slower but continued economic growth supported that idea.Between job growth moving closer to pre-pandemic levels,healthy consumer confidence and spending,and continued weakness in manufacturing,the economy seemed to be settling into a soft landing,which could keep pulling inflation downward. In response,the
10-year
U.S. Treasury yield dropped back to levels last seen in August,driving markets higher.Changing expectations. Looking forward,we may see a change in expectations in the new year. Markets have been choppy so far this month,and there is commentary suggesting that they may have gotten ahead of themselves.After a strong year-end,the seasonal factors can be less positive at the start of the year,which could be a headwind. In addition,the Fed may start pushing back on rate cut expectations,which would be another negative. Overall,in my view,conditions should remain positive in January,but perhaps somewhat less so than last month.Current risks. While overall conditions remain positive,there are still risks. The Fed is concerned that inflation may return in some sectors,which must be watched for its effect on rates.The ongoing war in the Middle East shows signs of expanding and affecting trade routes and supply lines. And domestic politics remain a concern as the election gets closer. But with the fundamentals reasonably healthy and the macro picture stabilizing,many of the economic fears that pulled markets back last year may subside.The markets and inflation. As we start the year,the key issues will be whether growth continues at a slower rate and inflation moves downward. Market expectations on rates have changed rapidly. If the Fed continues to act in a dovish manner,that positive reaction could continue. That said,there is a mismatch between what the market expects (six or more rate cuts) and what the Fed says (only three rate cuts).That mismatch in the past has given rise to volatility,so this is a risk to watch,even if conditions otherwise remain favorable.That is the bottom line herewhile conditions are good,volatility looks likely. The last two months were great for markets as rates pulled back,but conditions could change. Looking forward to the new year,we are still not out of the woods with inflation or growth. And while the trends remain positive,risks may pick up again over the next couple of months.As of this mornings jobs report,job growth is still healthy. The things to watch going forward will be consumer confidence and consumer spending. If they remain at pre-pandemic levels,then a soft landing looks increasingly likely,and the Fed should continue to send dovish signals. If not,we could see more volatility.Even in the case of volatility,the solid fundamentals should limit the damage and help set us up for more growth later this year. I believe this is something to watch for,but not to worry about too much."
 Inveting.com,What Is in Store for 2024,2024-01-05,0.666667,"This year promises to be one of the most interesting years economically,politically,and market-wise in history. We have two significant global conflicts/wars ongoing,just as President Xi of China is reiterating his promise to annex Taiwan,and Kim Jong Un of North Korea threatens to wipe the US off the map. Meanwhile,we have the most likely Republican candidate getting thrown off state ballots under the disgusting guise of trying to preserve democracy. The US is sadly in the process of becoming a banana republic. Wars and revolutions are not a tail risk. They are happening now and are likely to metastasize in 2024.With this backdrop,we have the most expensive stock market in history prior to 2020. The price-to-sales ratio is 2.62,and the total market cap of equities is 176% of GDP; both figures are near record highs and dwarf the historical averages prior to the pandemic. And the equity risk premium is zero. Meaning the earnings yield of stocks is less than that yield offered by simply owning a risk-free T-bill. In other words,investors are not getting compensated at all for the extra risk of owning stocks over bonds.We think earnings growth this year will be in the low single digits at best. However,Wall Street gurus have penned in
S&P 500
EPS growth of nearly 12% this year. But even if that growth is somehow incredibly achieved,the market has already priced in that hope. The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.3. This P/E ratio is above the 5-year average of 18.8 and above the 10-year average 17.6,according to FactSet.Therefore,economic growth must absolutely soar in 2024 to justify these valuation metrics. Or,the Fed must slash borrowing costs back towards ZIRP. But the latter scenario would only occur if the Fed was reacting to an economy that was falling apart,which cannot be good news for stocks. Yet,even in the former scenario,the Fed would not be cutting rates at all. Nevertheless,there are 3 rate cuts indicated by the Feds dot plot,and the 6 cuts are being priced in by the futures market. Therefore,even in the highly unlikely scenario of exploding GDP this year,it would probably entail rising rates instead of rate cuts,which would still provide a headwind for stocks.The overhanging problem is that the Treasury must find a buyer for $7 trillion of government debt this year alone. $5 trillion must be rolled over,and $2 trillion will be needed to fund the annual deficit. This will put tremendous pressure on the bond market no matter what.The month of March will be key time for markets. The reverse repo facility should get run down in at the end of the Q1 or the start of Q2. That easy liquidity for the already illiquid bond market will disappear. March is also the month when the BTFP is scheduled to expire. This entails the process of the Fed selling $133 billion in Treasuries and MBS that are sharply underwater back to the banks; and in exchange,the banks pay 100 cents on the dollar to the Fed,plus interest. Powell needs to end this program to stop the rampant speculation on Wall Street and to ensure inflation retreats towards the 2% target. But doing so will wreak havoc on the regional banking system. His decision on this front will be critical.The recession penciled in for last year did not materialize because of the massive fiscal spending and the bailout of the entire regional banking system; a.k.a. BTFP. However,the conditions for engendering a recession have not been resolved,they have been exacerbatedregardless of the soft-landing mantra prevalent in the MSFM. They are screaming goldilocks while in reality,the economy is more fragile today than ever.This does not guarantee a recession; but it does virtually guarantee that a booming economy is not in the bag. And that means investors should not blindly own the S&P 500 and trust in a bull market that never ends.I very well understand that the Fed and Treasury will indeed seek to bailout every hiccup in the market and the economy. However,this is old news. The government rode to the rescue in the tech bubble recession at the turn of the millennia and during the global financial crisis and real estate crash of 2008. But neither ZIRP,or QE,or TARP,or any of the alphabet soup of bailout programs served to stop the 50% + debacle in markets.These inflationary bailouts do tend to paper over the issues eventually; but not immediately. And of course,they result in more problems that turn out to be much more dire and intractable in the long run. In the vanguard of these problems is another round of asset bubbles,even more debt being incurred,and the condition of out-of-control inflation,which further eviscerates the middle class.In sharp contrast to recent history,if the Fed and Treasury were to try and truncate the recession,debt default,and reconciliation of asset prices,by another round of money printing and spending this time around,they will be doing so with the sting of record-high inflation fresh in the minds of consumers and businesses and investors. Therefore,the confidence in the worlds reserve status of USD and the US bond market could be obliterated. Meaning,what we could very well see is a condition where the economy enters a recession but long-term bond yields go up instead of down as is usually the case. Such an unprecedented and dangerous combination of higher borrowing costs in a faltering economy would result in carnage for stock valuations.Financial conditions and credit spreads remain quiescent for now. Therefore,we remain net long in our Inflation/Deflation and Economic Cycle Model. But we remain ready to sprint for the narrow exit door once the sell signal is received.My prediction and admonishment for 2024,be prepared for everything.**Michael Pento is the President and Founder of

 Inveting.com,The Only 2 Ways to Win in Trading,2023-09-19,0.666667,"It doesnt matter if you are Warren Buffett holding positions for decades or Ken Griffith holding them for milliseconds - there are only two ways to trade.In trading you can either go with the price action - or in traders parlance trade flow or go against the price action or fade the move.If you are going to day trade against trend need to know three things - what to trade,when to trade and how much profit to go for.Here is a set up I trade every day in stock index futures. During the European open (around 4 am) stock futures usually make a session high or session low that is fadable for at least 20 points. And even if the trade doesnt work the first time it usually resolves in profit on the second or the third attempt.But trend! Trend is something different altogether. Trend or flow trading has a very specific tell that can give very accurate reads on the market.Here is my proprietary bounce indicator in Flow mode. Notice anything? Flow trades which are bright green tiles on the chart tend to bunch together. Once a flow trade takes shape it tends to be followed by another.So what does that mean to us as retail traders?Simple. We only take a flow trade if the prior trade hit the take profit. If the prior trade was a loss we STOP TRADING until flow turn profitable again. Using this stop and go method we avoid the dreaded churn and increase our chance of winning trades tremendously.So here is the surprising takeaway for day trading. To trade counter trend you need to keep trying until you find the turn in the price action. But to trade trend you need stop and go stop and go until you sync yourself up with the trend move in the market.Thats pretty much the opposite of what most traders do - but now you know!"

Charlie Munger
. ""The whole secret of investment is to find places where it is safe and wise not to diversify,"" Munger once said.For an investor focused on speculative growth stocks,diversification is the name of the game. When the risk associated with any individual stock in your portfolio is high,spreading out your investments is essential. Ideally,the few big winners will more than offset the many losers.An alternative strategy is to avoid highly risky stocks altogether. Instead,identify opportunities where the risk is low and few things need to go right for the stock to do well. That's Munger's investment strategy in a nutshell,and it's mine as well.The top three stocks in my portfolio make up 32% of the total value. The remaining 68% is split between 21 other stocks.

Boeing 737 Max Blowout Points to Pervasive FlawsSaudi Aramco cut the official selling price for its flagship Arab Light crude to a $1.50-a-barrel premium to the regional benchmark for February,the lowest since November 2021. The $2-a-barrel reduction was deeper than foreseen,and follows a weakening of spot differentials for Middle Eastern crudes due to lackluster Chinese appetite and increased global supplies.Oil capped the first annual loss since 2020 last year as non-OPEC+ production expanded,and traders looked ahead to slower growth in demand,including from key importer China. Crudes weakness has prompted Riyadh to make a deep voluntary output cut,as well as complementary reductions from other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.Saudi pricing has been lowered in line with the spot market,which may potentially boost margins for customers that use the kingdoms cargoes as their baseload,refiners and traders said. Aramcos pricing is typically followed by other major producers in the Middle East such as Kuwait and Iraq.Still,at least three Asian customers said the price drop was unlikely to lead to requests for incremental deliveries from the Saudis as there are cheaper,rival supplies still available in the spot market. Two Chinese buyers said they wont be lifting any term cargoes from the Saudis for next month.Last month,Chinese refiners said they would receive less Saudi crude on-month for January loading. Asian crude buyers were also seen turning elsewhere after the kingdom reduced pricing of its key grade by only half the amount forecast.--With assistance from Sarah Chen.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Americas Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs

The two parties reached a settlement on the eve of the trial,one of Haslams representatives confirmed.Although details of the settlement havent yet been made public,the deal is likely to clear the way for Buffett to purchase the remaining 20% of Pilot Travel from Haslam later this month under terms of the original acquisition. The accord means both sides will dismiss all claims against each other,according to Haslams spokesperson.A docket filing in Delaware Chancery Court said the trial,scheduled for Monday in Wilmington before Judge Morgan Zurn,had been cancelled. A lawyer for Buffett didnt immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Haslam,the owner of the NFLs Cleveland Browns,was expected to testify live in the trial,but Buffett was not.The settlement resolves a case that set up a bitter legal battle between the two billionaires. Haslam contends Pilot Travel executives installed by Buffett changed quarterly-earning accounting methods in a way that will cut the value of his holdings by $1.2 billion if the Tennessee-based billionaire choses to sell Buffett his remaining stake.Read More"

Boeing CEOs Comeback Plan for 2024 Takes a Hit Five Days InWould-be Bitcoin ETF issuers have been given until Monday morning in Washington to submit any last-minute revisions to their pending applications,Bloomberg News has reported. The US Securities and Exchange Commission itself has until Jan. 10 to take action on at least one of those applications,and crypto insiders have speculated the regulator will use that date to announce a slew of decisions at once.There are two technical requirements that must be fulfilled before a spot-backed Bitcoin ETF can start trading. First,the SEC must sign off on so-called 19b-4 filings by the exchanges that would list the ETFs. Second,the regulator must approve the relevant S-1 forms,which are the registration applications from the would-be issuers  a list that includes BlackRock and Fidelity.The SEC is planning to vote on the exchanges filings,the 19b-4s,in the coming days,Bloomberg News has reported. The regulator may or may not then take action on the issuers applications,the S-1s,around the same time. If the SEC grants both sets of required approvals,the ETFs could start trading as soon as the next business day.An SEC representative declined to comment on the status of the applications.ETF ImpactBitcoins boosters say ETFs backed by the largest crypto token would represent a watershed moment for digital assets. Billions of dollars are at stake,representing potential inflows from retail and institutional investors alike.The market is still seriously underestimating the potential impact of a Bitcoin ETF approval,said Michael Anderson,co-founder of crypto venture firm Framework Ventures.Story continuesBut the SEC under the Democrat Gary Gensler and his Trump-era predecessor Jay Clayton has previously refused to allow such a product to launch,citing concerns about investor protection and the potential for market manipulation.However,speculation has been mounting since August,when the SEC lost a key legal fight against crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments,that the regulator will have to acquiesce to the growing clamor for the product.Market wagers that regulatory approval is on the horizon fueled a jump of approximately 160% in Bitcoin last year. That still wasnt enough to re-attain the record highs set in November 2021,when Bitcoin hit almost $69,000.The token has stayed in a relatively tight range around $44,000 since the start of 2024.

Boeing 737 Max Blowout Points to Pervasive FlawsThe dynamic was on display Friday,when bond prices dipped after the Labor Department reported that job growth unexpectedly accelerated last month. But the selloff was curtailed because buyers swooped in as 10-year Treasury yields neared 4.1%,the highest since mid-December.The rebound  even in the face of data showing continued strength in the economy  highlighted the stark shift in sentiment over the past two months,with investors increasingly confident that the bond market is firmly recovering from its worst downturn in decades. Despite the recent backup,yields are still well below Octobers peaks as traders wager that the Fed may start easing monetary policy as soon as March.Anything between 4% and 4.2% is a buy for the 10-year,said Priya Misra,portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management,noting that the yield was at the upper end of that range ahead of the last Fed meeting. For 4.2% to break,we have to bring hikes back in or take out overall cuts.The rally that gripped the bond market during the last two months of 2023 put an end to what had been the worst losses in decades,driving Treasuries to a gain for the year and bolstering conviction that yields wont retest the previous peaks. While investors are mindful that yields may drift higher if incoming data alters expectations about the Feds likely path,some big investment firms have been looking at recent drops as good times to buy.Australian and New Zealand yields moved higher on Monday,though the moves were in line with those seen for Treasuries on Friday. The yield on Australian 10-year notes added four basis points to 4.17%,after similar-dated US rates climbed five basis points to 4.05% at the end of last week. New Zealand 10-year yields rose six basis points to 4.61%. Cash Treasuries are shut in Asian hours Monday because Japan is on holiday.Story continuesStrategists at TD Securities told clients Friday that while bonds could still slide further in the near-term they remained convinced the labor market is cooling and the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2024 at 3%.The bond market is not ready to give up on their optimistic assessment for Fed rate cuts this year,said Kevin Flanagan,head of fixed-income strategy at WisdomTree. A narrative of buying on the dips will remain,and it will take more than one jobs report to change that.Not all segments of the bond market are seen as sheltered from losses,with policy-sensitive two-year bonds potentially at risk to repricing if traders dial back rate-cut bets further due to the strength of the economy. And the market is facing further tests this week,with the release of the December consumer-price index reading and a $37 billion 10-year Treasury auction that will provide a key gauge of demand. Theres also focus on a public appearance by New York Fed President John Williams,who has been among officials recently pushing back on market expectations for steep rate reductions early this year.But the Fed has held policy steady since July,and the December meeting minutes released Wednesday showed that policymakers anticipated that they would likely begin easing this year.Read More"
Yahoo Finance ,Analysis-Unloved healthcare stocks draw investors despite US election risks,2024-01-08,0.555556,"By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. healthcare sector is showing signs of life after lagging in 2023 as investors bet cheap valuations will offset a tendency to underperform during presidential election years.The S&P 500 healthcare sector has climbed about 6% since the start of December,doubling the gain of the broader index during that period. Its performance during 2023 overall was far less impressive,as it rose just 0.3% compared to the S&P 500s 24% jump.Healthcare,which has a roughly 13% weight in the S&P 500,was one of the areas left behind last year as investors flocked to the narrow group of massive tech and growth stocks that propelled indexes higher.The rise of new obesity treatments sparked worries that there would be less need for medical treatments aimed at weight-related health conditions at the same time demand for COVID-19 products waned.The sector's lackluster showing has made it an attractive target for investors looking for undervalued areas of the market. The healthcare sector trades at 17.9 times forward earnings estimates versus a P/E ratio of 19.7 for the S&P 500,a discount of 9%. Historically,healthcare has traded at a 4% premium to the broader index,data from LSEG Datastream showed.Investors are starting to look out for those sectors that didnt work in 2023,and healthcare fits that bill,said Art Hogan,chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth,who is recommending investors ""overweight"" the healthcare sector.Some investors are also betting that the rally that boosted tech and growth stocks will spread to other areas - a phenomenon that appears to have started late last year as banks,small caps and other unloved areas of the market drew heavy buying.Earnings are another potential bright spot,with companies in healthcare expected to increase profits by 17.5% in 2024,versus an 11.1% rise for the S&P 500 overall,according to LSEG data.Last year was a very narrow market and I think that broadens out in 2024 and creates opportunities for lots of different stocks to perform better,including healthcare stocks,said Michael Smith,senior portfolio manager for Allspring Global's Discovery Large Cap Growth Fund,which owns shares of UnitedHealth Group,Intuitive Surgical and Veeva Systems.Story continuesThe discount is more acute in certain areas of healthcare.Excluding Eli Lilly,whose shares soared last year on enthusiasm over the potential of its weight-loss treatment,a group of large-cap drugmakers and biotech companies tracked by JPMorgan were trading at a 30% discount to the S&P 500,a ""historically low"" level,the bank's analysts said in a note late last month.Patrick Kaser,a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global,said the firm's value-stock funds are significantly overweight the sector,including holdings in CVS Health,Bristol Myers Squibb and Viatris.Classically,value investors are looking for a group that is out of favor with low valuations,"" Kaser said. ""Healthcare checks both those boxes really well right now.REASONS FOR CAUTIONAn early test for the sector comes at this week's JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco,where investors are gathering to hear dozens of companies forecast the year ahead and talk about their prospects.There are reasons for caution regarding healthcares performance in 2024.The widely expected scenario of a stable but slowing economy,ebbing inflation and falling interest rates could give investors little reason to abandon the big tech and growth stocks that worked for them last year. Those same factors could also be more favorable to sectors that are more tightly linked to the economy,such as financials and industrials.Healthcare stocks also tend to struggle in presidential election years,as the cost of medical care frequently emerges as a political issue that puts the industry in the crosshairs. The sector has only beaten the S&P 500 in three of the past 12 presidential election years,according to Strategas.However,some investors believe this year's presidential contest poses less risk to healthcare stocks than recent past elections.Neither political party is expected to gain significant majorities in Congress,diminishing the chances of major legislation that overhauls the industry,while President Joe Biden already enacted legislation during his first term that addresses drug prices.Generally,healthcare is ""an easy target for politicians,"" said Kaser.This year,""I dont think there is a likely outcome of anything big and new hitting the sector...

The entry said it was authorized by Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn,the judge.The Haslam family,Berkshire Hathaway and the chambers for Zurn could not be reached for comment.The two-day non-jury trial in Delaware's Court of Chancery was meant to determine the value of the Haslam family's 20% stake in Pilot Travel Centers,the largest U.S. truck stop chain.It was expected to feature testimony from Buffett's designated successor,Greg Abel.The Haslams,including Cleveland Browns football team owner Jimmy Haslam,sold Berkshire 80% of Pilot for $11 billion in two separate deals,in 2017 and January 2023.They also have a put option,allowing them to sell the remaining 20% in the first two months of any year.Pilot,which also operates under the Flying J brand,has about 650 locations and sold 13 billion gallons of fuel in 2022.Each side has accused the other of accounting tricks to manipulate the Knoxville,Tennessee-based company's earnings before interest and taxes,or EBIT,which determines the value of the Haslam's 20% stake.According to the Haslams,after Berkshire obtained the 80% Pilot stake it adopted ""pushdown accounting"" that would reduce how much it would owe if the put option were exercised.A lawyer for Berkshire said in court that depending on which side's accounting was used,EBIT would differ by $1.2 billion.The trial outcome would have turned on a simple question"

dropped towards 2,025 after the release of higher-than-expected NFP figures. However, the pair rose after ISM Services PMI numbers appeared lower than the forecast, reaching 2,064. Friday's data revealed that 216,000 new jobs were added in December, exceeding the forecast of 170,000. Thus, the data indicates the labor market's robustness even under tight financial conditions.

However, recent comments from Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda caused speculation about Japan potentially moving away from its negative interest rate monetary policy. Last month, Ueda mentioned an increasing probability that Japan is leaving a period of low inflation and reaching its price stability goal.

Yahoo Finance,I'm Almost 60 and Have $1 Million in My IRA. Should I Switch to Roth Contributions?,2024-01-08,0.666667,"A 60-year-old man considers whether to contribute to a Roth IRA instead of a traditional IRA.Should you switch from pre-tax IRA contributions to Roth contributions?Imagine that youre steadily contributing to a
traditional IRA
. This provides you with an annual tax deduction. However, contributing to a tax-deferred account comes at the cost of having to pay taxes on all of the money you withdraw in retirement. Switching to a
Roth IRA
would reverse this dynamic, leaving you with less capital after paying taxes upfront in exchange for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals.As with all tax questions, the right decision will depend on your circumstances. The answer here may be to speak with a professional to determine what you should do. But in the meantime, here are a few things to think about.(And if you need help finding a financial advisor, consider using this
free matching tool
to connect with one.)Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRAA traditional IRA is what's called a pre-tax or tax-deferred account. You don't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it. However, youll owe
income tax
on the full balance  your original investment plus any gains.A Roth IRA is an after-tax account. You don't get a tax deduction for your contributions but you typically pay no taxes on the money when you withdraw it. That means your money grows tax-free. A bonus of Roth IRAs is that they arent subject to
required minimum distributions
(RMDs), which can increase your tax bill in retirement. (Remember, a
financial advisor
can potentially help you navigate RMDs and build a plan for limiting your tax liability in retirement.)Both types of IRAs have the same
annual contribution limits
. In tax year 2024, you can contribute up to $7,000 to your IRAs, plus an additional $1,000 if youre 50 or older. For tax year 2023, the IRS limits contributions to $6,500, plus the extra $1,000 if youre 50 or older.Opportunity Cost"

Yahoo Finance,The Federal Reserve Signals Interest Rate Cuts in 2024. History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.,2024-01-08,0.666667,"The Federal Reserve is charged with promoting maximum employment and price stability. To achieve those goals, it uses certain monetary policy tools to push the federal funds rate higher or lower. For context, the federal funds rate is a benchmark interest rate that influences other rates across the economy, including credit cards, personal loans, and mortgages.Ultimately, raising interest rates reduces spending and employment, which slows economic growth and brings inflation down. Conversely, lowering interest rates promotes spending and hiring, which accelerates economic growth and allows inflation to drift upward. The Federal Reserve, therefore, adjusts the federal funds target rate based on its monetary policy goals at any given time.In March 2022, officials began raising the benchmark rate to cool fierce inflation brought on by stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. The benchmark rate has since increased at its fastest pace in four decades, meaning credit conditions have tightened incredibly quickly. That dynamic is shown in the chart below.Image source"

Investing.com,The Reckoning in Pension Funds Draws Closer,2024-01-08,0.333333,"By Clint Siegner, Money Metals Exchange
The outlook for pension systems is growing increasingly dire. Promises made to retirees have been generous and they can only be kept if prices for all kinds of assets move consistently higher.
The trouble is that the past three years dont look like the first twenty years of the century.
The 40-year bull market in bonds ended. Commercial real estate is in deep trouble. And there are many indications that a recession is coming, which should translate to lower stock prices.
Now some large pension programs are looking to borrow money to meet their obligations. The union-boss-controlled California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) announced plans to borrow $30 billion in an effort to avoid selling distressed real estate and bonds.
They dont have much choice. Cutting retirement benefits is forbidden by law.
For some systems in certain locales, such as the government employee pensions in Illinois, changing the law means amending the states constitution -- a political impossibility.
The CalSTRS move to borrow roughly 10% of its total asset value smells of desperation. It is a gamble which pays off if there is a big recovery in commercial real estate and bond prices.
The outlook for commercial real estate remains gloomy. The retail sector has struggled for years due to the ongoing transition from brick-and-mortar to online shopping.
More recently demand for office space has been in decline. Work from home was a trend prior to COVID, and it massively accelerated during the pandemic.
The most likely scenario for a recovery in bond prices involves a decline in stock prices.
The Fed isnt likely to start dropping interest rates until stock market weakness signals recession or even worse economic malaise.
If markets fall, it will only get harder and more expensive for pensions to borrow next time.
The alternatives to borrowing will be a fire sale of assets, or a bailout from either the state or federal government.
Given that California is facing a record $68 billion deficit and federal deficits are also skyrocketing, bailouts could be a difficult sell. Liberal California state politicians will likely want to rescue pensions, but they will have to borrow to do it. The states creditworthiness could be an issue.
At the federal level, a bailout to maintain lavish retirement benefits for teachers in California is going to be a hard sell among representatives from more conservative states.
Overextended pension systems managed to stay afloat when prices for equity, real estate and bonds all moved higher. The promises made to retirees assumed a mostly uninterrupted bull market in financial assets.
Few state pension systems allocate any of their assets to physical precious metals in order to protect retirees from inflation and credit risk. One notable exception is the Ohio Police and Firefighters Pension Fund which reported acquired a physical
gold
holding.
Now pension systems that are hitched entirely to financial assets must navigate potential bear markets and tighter borrowing conditions. Many of them may not succeed."
Investing.com,Jobs,2024-01-08,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Every month, we get a strong non-farm payroll report with a big headline number. Every month the market reacts with a stock market drop, a spike in dollar strength, and a selloff in
gold
, all in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will respond to the strong labor market by leaving interest rates higher for longer.
And every month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revises previous months' job numbers lower.
Thats the part nobody pays attention to.
For December, the BLS reported 216,000 new jobs. This was far higher than the 170,000 new jobs projected and resulted in the aforementioned knee-jerk reaction from the markets.
And then there were the revisions.
The BLS revised the November jobs number down to 173,000. It was originally reported as 199,000 new jobs. At the time, this was reported as slightly better than the 190,000 Dow Jones estimate. But we now know the real number was a big miss. It wasn't ""slightly better"" than the estimate. It was ""way worse.""
The BLS also revised Octobers number down to 105,000 new jobs created. The BLS originally reported 150,000 new jobs created in October.
Thats 71,000 jobs that just poof disappeared with no fanfare.
And this isnt an anomaly.
The BLS revised 10 of the last 11 non-farm payroll reports lower.
Notice the pattern.
By the way, the fantastic December jobs report wasnt that great when you dig into the numbers. A big chunk of those new jobs were government jobs (52,000). There was a record 1.5 million crash in the number of full-time jobs. The labor force participation clicked downward. And we have more and more Americans working multiple jobs trying to make ends meet. (Every time some guy starts delivering pizzas at night on top of his day job to keep up with rising prices, that counts as a new job.)
But thats not even the point.
Even if we take the BLS numbers at face value and cheer because the economy created more jobs than projected, history tells us that the agency will revise those numbers down next month, and theres a pretty darn good chance that December's beat will turn into a miss.
And nobody will notice.
The markets only react to the initial numbers. You never see a gold rally because the BLS erased a bunch of jobs from the economy with a few clicks of its calculator. The revisions happen quietly in the back alleys. Nobody pays any attention to them. That creates the illusion that the labor market is much stronger than it actually is.
So, why should we trust any of these numbers, much less make decisions based on them?
And notice that the revisions are always down. If the BLS was making honest mistakes month after month, you would think sometimes they would underestimate the number of jobs created. But they always overestimate the numbers. If you flipped a coin and it came up heads 10 out of 11 times, youd start to wonder about the integrity of that coin, wouldnt you?
Again, its important to wrap your head around the pattern here.
This month, the government reports good news. Everybody celebrates. Markets move. The following month, the government quietly revises everything downward and reports that the good news was really bad news.
And nobody pays attention.
It might be a good idea to pay attention -- to the revisions too. Things arent nearly as rosy as the headlines would indicate."

The business is still based in the small city where Coates was born, but raked in 3.39 billion ($4.3 billion) in 2023.According to its latest accounts, seen by

Yahoo Finance,Ask an Advisor,2024-01-08,0.666667,"Financial advisor and columnist Brandon RenfroI'm 55 and would like to retire now with a $3 million total net worth. I'm assuming my net worth will grow, on average, 5% until Im eligible for Social Security. My house is paid off and my lifestyle is simple. I can live with $5,000 per month. Am I making the right decisions? PeterAt first blush, supporting $5,000 in monthly living expenses on $3 million seems like an easy feat. But I like to start by thinking about scenarios like this in terms of your
distribution rate
 the percentage of your money you'll be withdrawing each year. Withdrawing $60,000 per year would equate to just a 2% annual withdrawal rate, which is incredibly low by pretty much anyones standards. That would put you at very little risk of running out of money.However, since you say ""
net worth
"" instead of nest egg or savings, I would encourage you to take a hard look at how your net worth is composed. Are your assets mostly liquid, like stocks and cash? Or is your net worth primarily tied up in illiquid assets, such as real estate? The answer may dictate how much you can afford to withdraw. (And if you need more help determining when you can retire,
consider speaking with a financial advisor
.)Examining Your Net WorthYour net worth is the value of all of your assets minus any debts. For example, if you own a property that's worth $500,000 and have a $300,000
mortgage
, it contributes $200,000 to your net worth. Of course, your investments, cash and other savings all contribute to your net worth as well.I mention this because the way your $3 million net worth is spread across different types of assets can affect how capable you are of supporting yourself with it. All assets don't provide the same level of flexibility.To illustrate my point, consider this hypothetical scenario"

What Can I Do With It?",2024-01-08,0.666667,"While many retirement accounts offer tax-sheltered ways to save and invest, the IRS mandates accountholders start withdrawing money at a certain point. This takes the form of required minimum distributions (RMDs).
Required minimum distributions
currently start at age 73 for many retirement accounts.Its not uncommon to reach an age when the IRS requires you to start withdrawing money from retirement accounts that you dont need to tap just yet. RMDs can trigger taxes and likely wont generate a competitive return in your checking account. Instead, here are some ways to think about managing this money.If youre looking to build a tax-efficient plan for retirement,
talk to a financial advisor today.Why Plan for RMDs?Required minimum distributions, or RMDs, are withdrawals that the IRS requires you to make from most tax-advantaged retirement accounts. They apply to all pre-tax accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k)s. They do not apply to
Roth IRAs
and, effective 2024, will no longer apply to
Roth 401(k)s
.Starting at age 73,
everyone
with a qualifying account must take this minimum withdrawal each year.This rule applies per-account, not per-taxpayer. So, say you have both an IRA and a 401(k), then each account will have its own minimum annual withdrawal. The
IRS calculates
your minimum withdrawals
based on
your age and the accounts value.For example, say that you turned 73 this year and have $500,000 in an IRA. The IRS
would
require you to withdraw at least $18,867 from this IRA by the end of 2023.With a $1 million retirement account, an annual minimum withdrawal of $37,735 would be required.These are the rules for retirement accounts that you contributed to. Inherited retirement accounts also have required minimum distributions for heirs who receive them. Often you must withdraw this money within 10 years of inheriting it, but
the specifics
vary widely based on the nature of the account and its original owner.Remember, a
financial advisor
can help you determine the best way to structure your withdrawals.Story continuesWhat Can You Do With Your RMDs?At age 73 you can realistically have decades ahead of you, so dont just take out this cash and put it into a depository account. A few ways you can make the money work for you include"

(AP)  Following the settlement of a lawsuit pitting Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam against fellow billionaire Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway, the clock is ticking for the Haslam family to decide whether to sell its remaining stake in the Pilot truck stop chain to Berkshire.Attorneys told a Delaware judge last week that they were prepared for a two-day trial starting Monday in a high-stakes dispute over accounting practices at Pilot Travel Centers LLC. Late Saturday, however, the judge entered an order indicating that the trial had been canceled.On Sunday, Haslams Pilot Corp. announced that the case, including Berkshires counterclaims against Pilot Corp., had been fully settled. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.With the dispute resolved, the Haslams must now decide whether to sell their remaining 20% stake in Pilot Travel Centers to Berkshire in line with a 2017 business deal. PTC, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee, is a diversified fuel company that operates more than 650 travel centers, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, in 43 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces.A spokeswoman for Pilot Corp. declined to comment Monday on whether the Haslam family, which includes former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, will sell its remaining stake in PTC to Berkshire. A spokeswoman for Berkshire did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Berkshire purchased an initial 38.6% stake in PTC in 2017 for $2.76 billion. The two sides agreed at that time that Berkshire would take control of PTC by acquiring an additional 41.4% interest in January 2023. The price tag for that control purchase was roughly $8.2 billion.The 2017 agreements also gave Pilot Corp. an annual 60-day opportunity, beginning Jan. 1 this year, to sell its remaining 20% interest in PTC to Berkshire. The sale price would be calculated using PTCs earnings in the prior year.With the first sale deadline approaching, however, the two sides accused each other of trying to manipulate the companys financial records in order to affect the price Berkshire would have to pay for the Haslam familys remaining 20% stake in the truck-stop chain.Story continuesIn a Chancery Court complaint, attorneys for Haslam noted that an SEC filing by Berkshire last year listed Pilot Corp.s redeemable noncontrolling interest in PTC at about $3.2 billion. Pilot alleged, however, that after taking control of PTC, Berkshire adopted pushdown accounting, that resulted in the company reporting lower net income. Pilot claimed that a 2017 agreement prevents Berkshire from making such an accounting change without Pilots consent.Berkshire responded with allegations that Haslam
tried to bribe employees
at the Pilot truck stop chain to inflate the companys value in order to increase the amount Berkshire would have to pay.An attorney for Pilot told the Delaware judge last month that federal prosecutors have begun an investigation based on Berkshires bribery allegations."

Investing.com,2 Common Misconceptions About Long-Term Bear Markets,2024-01-09,0.666667,"Much of what is thought and believed about the stock market is based upon fallacy and a lack of understanding, which was easily seen in the comments section of one of my recent articles.It seems that manyinvestors felt quite strongly that a long-term bear market is simply an impossibility.They attempted to outline their reasoning in the comments section of my latest articles. So, I am going to discuss the issues they brought up in a series of articles over the coming weeks.I will be breaking the discussion down into six general topics raised in the comments section.Due to the areas of discussion, I am going to cover, I am going to split this discussion up into three articles, as it would be too long for just one article. These are the topics which willbe covered.Since we are dealing with financial markets, which are non-linear and uncertain environments, I want to make it clear upfront that depression is obviously not a foregone conclusion.Therefore, I will end this series of articles outlining what I will need to see over the coming two years to tell me whether we are indeed heading into a 13-21-year bear market.And, if the market takes the path I lay out over the coming two years, then it will make a long-term bear market a high probability.Until such time, I am going to be taking my cues from the market action week by week and month by month, and will not likely take on an extreme bearish posture until I see strong confirmation in the next year or two.But, I will likely be raising a lot of cash in the coming months.So let's get started.Those who have followed my analysis over the last 13 years know that I have caught most (but not all, as we are not perfect) of the major turns in all the assets I cover.While I only cover the

Investing.com,Stock markets flirt with record highs,2024-01-09,0.444444,
Investing.com,2024 Survey,2024-01-09,0.666667,"During the last week of December, I polled my Twitter followers for their outlook on the markets and the economy for 2024. The results were quite interesting, but before we look forward, we must look back at 2023 for context.Last year was not what the majority of mainstream economists and analysts predicted.Going into last year, expectations for a recession and negative market returns were high. The table below shows some important events and market reactions during the previous year for the
S&P 500
. Each one of those events was expected to disrupt the market.Yet, despite higher Fed funds rates, rising interest rates, bank failures, and fiscal concerns, the market closely followed the seasonal pattern of a pre-election year.The correction during the summer certainly had the bears coming out of hibernation, but the bulls were entirely in charge by year-end. The chart is the combined net bullish sentiment index (professional and retail) compared to the S&P 500 index.So, with the understanding that 2023 defied all previous expectations, what do investors enter 2024 think regarding the market and the economy?With the S&P 500 ending the year 24% higher than where it started, 42% believe 2024 will end lower than the years close of 4769.However, if we split the 4600-5000 band, roughly 50% think the year will be lower. Interestingly, 24% expect returns above the 2024 market consensus of 5200.Of course, for the market to generate those returns, the economy must avoid a recession. When asked that question, 45% of those polled believe there is more than a 50% chance of a recession, with 13.6% at a 100% conviction.Here is the problem with that view. In an economic downturn, the market must reprice earnings for slower economic growth.Therefore, given that 2023 was a year driven by multiple expansions, there is significant room for a repricing of earnings if a recession develops.Given that recent economic data has slowed, the more optimistic view of the market will become more challenging as forward earnings estimates continue to decline.Following that poll question of recession expectations, I asked about real
GDP
growth
(inflation-adjusted).
40.2% of those polled expect the economy to avoid a recession but exhibit growth below 2%. Only 28% expect a recession.Again, given that earnings are derived from economic activity, the problem of current growth estimates will be more challenging to obtain.Such is mainly the case given that earnings growth estimates for 2024 are highly elevated relative to historical norms.With valuations on the rise, as earnings fail to keep pace with price increases, the risk of a repricing event increases if earnings fail to meet current expectations.What could keep earnings under pressure? Such would be a slower economy impacted by higher inflation, unemployment, and interest rates.The 2024 poll became more interesting when explicitly asked about the underlying factors of the economy. For example, more than 68% of those polled believed the
unemployment rate
would rise above 4% this year.Given last Fridays BLS employment reports sharp drop in full-time employment, there is certainly some evidence to suggest economic deterioration is in process.
(We will discuss this in further detail on Friday.)However, if employment is expected to fall, then higher rates of inflation are much less probable.Such is because of the supply/demand relationship that drives employment over time. Therefore, the 65% of respondents who believe inflation will be higher than 3% over the next year will likely be disappointed.Another dichotomy in the survey was interest rates. Most respondents also think interest rates will be higher over the next year.The issue is the high correlation between inflation, interest rates, wages, and economic growth. Such was a point
discussed
previously.While it is not near recessionary levels yet, the data trend is slowing. As noted, with an 87% correlation to economic growth, the slower pace will eventually manifest in lower interest rates and inflation.Given that these polls were taken over a week, the participants in the survey were not the same. Such accounts for the diversity of responses in the poll.While you should not make any assumptions from these polls, the responses were interesting. Overall, most participants are more bearish on the markets and economy for the coming year.This was the case last year, and the markets defied those expectations.However, a critical takeaway is that the economy can not be weaker and have higher inflation and interest rates. If employment is slowing, as it looks like, the real risk is slower economic growth, lower rates, and further disinflation.If such is the case, the current earnings growth expectations this year remain elevated even though they have already been revised lower.Such potentially creates the potential for investor disappointment and a repricing of markets to correspond with reduced valuation assumptions.While we have no idea how 2024 will eventually turn out, the risk is that the markets may defy more bearish expectations again, hoping the Federal Reserve will offset any risk with accommodative actions.Or maybe this is the year the
Bears
get it right.The best we can do is pay attention to the changes in the data, manage risk, and be willing to change our views as needed."

But you won't need aggressive or unrealistic returns, putting you in a comfortable position to enjoy the good life today.Here are a few things to think about, in addition to talking through your plan with a
financial advisor.Plan for Secure, but Steady, Portfolio ReturnsThis portfolio should last you for a long time, said Matt WillerManaging Director of Capital Markets, Partner, at
Phoenix Capital Group Holdings, LLC,
provided you invest it wisely. Fortunately, wisely doesn't have to mean speculatively.""Interest rates [today] allow investors today to comfortably generate 5-6% annual yields with virtually no risk Assuming all the savings are taxable, and not in qualified accounts, this translates to at least $100-120k in annual gross interest income, and post taxes is still beyond sufficient to meet the $6,000 after tax expense requirement,"" said Willer.You can increase this even more by accepting modest risk into your portfolio. A blended portfolio, with a good mix of bonds and stocks, will often return an average 8%  11% return said Willer. This can not only provide a generous retirement income and lifestyle, albeit one that will require some risk-management plans but will give you a hedge against inflation.Talk to a financial advisor
about the best investment strategy for you.Invest and Prepare for Personal InflationHedging inflation should be a major priority, and national inflation and your personal inflation may not always be the same thing.Story continuesThe Federal Reserve sets a benchmark inflation rate of around 2%, typically accepting any number between 2% and 3%. That rate alone will double your costs of living roughly every 30 years. Your personal spending power may erode even faster, said,Vijay Marolia,Managing Partner of
Regal Point Capital
, because of the costs associated with how and where you live.This is
personal inflation,
the idea that the costs you pay for your life and lifestyle may grow more quickly than the national averages.For example, say that you rent an apartment in a popular city. Historically, your housing costs will increase much faster than 2%. If you enjoy travel, then your entertainment costs have surged over the past two years. Meat eaters have seen their grocery bills rise faster than vegetarians, and pedestrians aren't as individually worried about gas prices.All of this can mean that your household's costs might not match the national CPI.For example, said Marolia, assume that you have 5% returns from an income-generating portfolio. After taxes that will leave you with $6,250 per month, meeting your current needs.""Don't get too excited, because what looks like a $250 per month surplus may not remain as such; it's only a 4% margin. If one experiences a personal inflation rate of only 5% than this eats the entire surplus and some. Why? Because at 5% inflation, monthly expenses rise to $6,300 per month, or $50 less than you need,""Marolia said.This isn't a dealbreaker, you still have enough money saved up to manage this risk. Just make sure that you do manage it.A
financial advisor
can help you map out budget projections for your retirement.Early Retirement IssuesPersonal inflation is a particularly important issue for early retirees.The reason to retire at 55 is so that you can enjoy your lifestyle. It would defeat the entire point if you priced yourself out of your standard of living. So make sure that you invest for the kind of growth you will need to stay comfortable, not just barely making it on a fixed budget.Beyond that, it's important to remember that early retirement adds a host of new issues to your retirement planning. Two of the most important are health care and
Social Security
.First, you will need to anticipate health insurance.
Medicare
won't kick in until age 65 and, until then, most people rely on their employer for insurance coverage. By retiring early you will need to buy your own coverage. Unless you currently pay for insurance, this will probably add
about $500
to your anticipated monthly budget.Even once Medicare does kick in, you will still need to budget for
gap
and
long-term care insurance
, so don't count on that extra spending to fall off.Second, make a plan for Social Security. One of the good things about having a well-funded retirement account is that you can delay taking Social Security, which will make those benefits more generous in the long run. Indeed, based on your numbers, collecting Social Security age at 70 can be a significant part of your inflation hedge. Just make sure you include this in your overall plan, because that money won't roll in for another 15 years.Consider
matching with a financial advisor
if you still have questions about the best way to finance your retirement.The Bottom LineAt age 55 with $2 million in the bank, you are well positioned to retire early. Just make sure that you anticipate the complicated issues around early retirement, including long-term inflation hedges and health insurance.Early Retirement TipsIf not every budget and inflation profile was made the same, nor was every retirement destination. Some states are simply cheaper to retire in, more fun to retire in or more comfortable in the long run.
Depending on how flexible you are about location, that can be an important part of your retirement plans.

blown out in mid-air
during a Alaska Airlines flight on Friday was the focus of a class-action lawsuit filed less than a month earlier, with the complaint alleging that Spirit AeroSystems had experienced ""sustained quality failures"" in its products.The complaint, filed on December 19 in federal court in New York, was filed on behalf of investors in Spirit AeroSystems, which was originally a manufacturing unit of Boeing until it was spun off in 2005 (The company has no relationship with Spirit Airlines.) According to the suit, Spirit relies heavily on Boeing for orders and manufactures much of the aviation giant's jet fuselages.The midair incident involved a door plug, panels designed to fit into doors that typically aren't needed on an aircraft, transforming them into windows. One of these plugs was sucked out of a
Boeing 737 Max 9
flown by Alaska Airlines just minutes after the plane departed Oregon's Portland International Airport on its way to Ontario, California.Alaska and United Airlines  the only two U.S. carriers to fly the Boeing 737 Max 9  have since said they have found
loose bolts
inside several other door plugs on the jets, which the Federal Aviation Administration has grounded.The lawsuit is noteworthy because of its allegations of manufacturing problems, including a complaint from one Spirit employee who alleged an ""excessive amount of defects"" in an email to one of the company's executives. While none of the issues flagged in the lawsuit specifically involve door plugs, the claim alleges that Spirit's ""quality failures were so severe and persistent that Boeing even placed Spirit on probation for multiple years.""Spirit declined to comment on the litigation. ""Spirit is following the protocols set by the regulatory authorities that guide communication in these types of circumstances, and we will share further information when appropriate,"" the company said a statement.Story continuesBoeing also declined to comment.

Yahoo Finance,Why Apple faces its biggest crisis since it was saved by the iPod,2024-01-09,0.222222,"Apple iPhoneTim Cook did not hold back. This is obviously a disaster, he told finance executives in a 2018 email, ordering his lieutenants to improve underwhelming sales of Apples latest iPhones.Apples business in China was sliding, leading to the companys first profit warning in 16 years. One executive described the performance as an extreme problem, while another said employees needed to respond as if it was a five alarm fire, according to emails recently released as part of a lawsuit against Apple.The company later reported two consecutive quarters of revenue decline, a rare dip for a business famous for reliably getting more cash out of its customers each year.At the time, blame for the poor sales was laid at the foot of
Huawei, the Chinese phone giant
seen as a domestic rival to the iPhone maker.I do think upgraders consider choices [like Huawei] to be more value for money, especially if they dont see major reasons and new innovation in the iPhone, wrote Apples head of marketing for China.Ultimately, Huawei did not kill Apples business in China. US sanctions effectively
crippled Huaweis ability to make high-end handsets
, handing an advantage to the iPhone maker in the process.Despite fraying relations between Beijing and Washington, Apple went on to post record sales in the Middle Kingdom.But Cook may have simply delayed the reckoning. Wall Street has recently sounded a new alarm on Apples business in China, sending the companys shares sliding.It is just one of a number of significant issues facing the worlds biggest company.In November, the company revealed revenues had fallen year-on-year for four consecutive quarters, the longest slump for more than two decades. Some analysts believe Apple could deliver a fifth quarter of decline when it reports Christmas sales in the coming weeks.This would mark its longest losing streak since 1998, the year after Steve Jobs returned to save the company from near-bankruptcy.Story continuesNobody is suggesting that Apple or Cook are in similar trouble. The company became the first business to hit a $3 trillion (2.4 trillion) valuation last year and shares hit a new all-time high just last month.The company has captured more than two thirds of the high-end segment of the smartphone market  the only part that is reliably profitable  and made profits of $97bn in its last financial year"

report will be released at 8"
Investing.com,CPI,2024-01-10,0.333333,"A lot is riding on tomorrows US consumer
inflation report
for December for markets, which are pricing in relatively upbeat news.Quite a lot of the stock markets upbeat profile recently is closely linked to forecasts that the worst has passed for inflation, which leaves room for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates.In that case, the market has a green light to reprice equity prices up, which its been doing to no trivial degree in recent months.Meanwhile, US Treasury yields have fallen recently, largely for the same reason. Tomorrows CPI report will provide a reality check on the rosy assumptions of late.Economists expect a bit of a mixed bag. For the year-over-year headline data, consumer inflation is projected to tick up to 3.2% from 3.1% in November.Thats still well below the recent trend, but the Feds 2% inflation target appears set to remain elusive for the immediate horizon.The sticky headline data will be offset by expectations for softer
core CPI
reading, which strips out food and energy in a bid to estimate a more reliable measure of the trend.This estimate of pricing pressure is on track to ease to 3.8% year-over-year in December. If correct, this crucial measure of inflation will dip below 4% for the first time in nearly three years.Nonetheless, Vanguards senior international economist says that Prices continue to fall at a rapid clip vs. the start of 2023, but Andrew Patterson doesnt expect that the Feds 2% target will arrive until late this year at the earliest.Pattersons outlook aligns with CapitalSpectator.coms econometric forecast for core CPI, based on a proprietary ensemble model. By the end of 2024, this estimate of year-over-year inflation is projected to slide to just over 2%, based on the point forecast.The case for expecting ongoing disinflation also looks persuasive via a set of alternative measures of pricing pressure (for a list, see p. 3 of this sample issue of The US Inflation Trend Chartbook, a companion newsletter for subscribers to The US Business Cycle Risk Report).In the chart below, the sliding trend remains intact and looks set to persist for the near term.For another perspective, consider how the bias compares in the chart above. In the next chart below, theres a clear downside bias for the monthly changes in the year-over-year data points.Although the numbers suggest more progress lies ahead in the battle to tame inflation, the potential for upside surprises can never be ruled out, particularly in the short term.But looking through the noise that could muddy the waters for any given month, the disinflation trend remains on track, even if thats not always obvious for anyone CPI update.Sam Bullard, managing director and chief economist for Wells Fargos corporate and investment banking group"

Accordingly, they have become more frequent and potent market forces.Following economic data, corporate earnings, politics, global affairs, and many other factors are still crucial for investors.Equally important, especially over short periods, is identifying which narrative(s) most heavily impact markets.Todays popular narrative is a growing consensus for the Fed to engineer a soft landing and a Goldilocks economy. Its worth appreciating the Fed and Jerome Powell, purposely or not, started the narrative.As the fiscal stimulus that drove above-average economic growth in the post-pandemic era exits the system and monetary policy remains very tight, economists and investors wonder what comes next.The scenario rapidly gaining in popularity is the Goldilocks narrative.In case you forgot, Goldilocks and The Three Bears start with Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear leaving their house for a walk while their porridge cools.Goldilocks enters their home and tastes the three bowls of porridge.

from December 2022, Kiyosaki emphasized this concept in an interview, saying, If you read Rich Dad, Poor Dad, rich dads lesson No. 1  rich dont work for money. He went on to say, The people that are being screwed today are the poor middle class because they work for money.He said he believes that the rich are adept at navigating economic challenges, seeing them as opportunities to acquire undervalued assets and invest in innovation. In contrast, those in poverty often exacerbate their situation by incurring more debt.Kiyosakis philosophy centers around the idea of working to learn, not just to earn.

Getty ImagesThe S&P 500 could jump 10% to a record 5,200 points this year, Jeremy Siegel says.
The ""Wizard of Wharton"" says the Fed's willingness to cut rates is more important than doing so.
Siegel warns that a flurry of cuts might signal a recession that could pull down stocks.The S&P 500 could surge by 10% to a record high of 5,200 points this year  and plunging interest rates could spell trouble for stocks, Jeremy Siegel says.The retired finance professor known as the ""Wizard of Wharton"" said the US economy is growing at a ""Goldilocks pace"" in his
WisdomTree commentary
this week. It's not expanding quickly enough to scare the Federal Reserve into cooling it down, but it's still strong enough to fuel growth in corporate earnings and shore up stocks, he said.""If real economic growth stays strong, the Fed could keep rates exactly where they are, and we could have strong equity markets,"" he said. The rosy economic backdrop could underpin an 8% to 10% rise in the S&P 500 this year, and push smaller-cap value stocks up 15% given their depressed valuations, he added.The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate from nearly zero to north of 5% since early 2022, in an effort to wrestle historic inflation back to its 2% target. Steeper borrowing costs can temper price growth by discouraging spending, investing, and hiring, but they can also sap demand so much that the economy shrinks and a recession takes hold.Siegel disagreed with the idea that the Fed needs to slash rates aggressively this year for stocks to perform well. The key thing is that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled he's ready to reverse some of the central bank's hikes if the economy weakens, he said.""That willingness to cut is more important than having the cut,"" he
told CNBC
on Monday. ""Honestly, I would love the economy to keep on chugging along, and if it chugs along at 5% fed funds, that's not bad for stocks.""Story continuesThe author of ""Stocks for the Long Run"" said he expected the Fed to lower rates as inflation cools further  a prospect he hailed as ""a real positive for the market going forward."" Yet he noted that a flurry of cuts could indicate a sharp economic slowdown that spooks consumers and investors and hits company earnings.""One has to realize big rate cuts might mean a real slowdown and recession,"" he said. ""Well, the stock market doesn't want that.""Siegel
has been bullish on stock and the economy for a while
. In December, he suggested that house prices could rise by 5% to 10% this year, inflation might slow to around 2.5%, the risk of recession was below 50%, and the Fed might cut rates by five or six times to below 4%.Read the original article on

Yahoo Finance,Do I really need supplemental insurance (Medigap) with Medicare?,2024-01-09,0.333333,"About 41% of Original Medicare beneficiaries had
Medicare Supplement Insurance
, or Medigap, in 2021, according to a February 2023 report summarizing enrollment data from AHIP, a national health insurance trade association. For the other 59%, Medicare has some gaps that could be costly.There are many gaps in Medicare that a beneficiary has to pay if they dont have a Medigap, Kelli Jo Greiner, Minnesota State Health Insurance Assistance Program director, said in an email. This can add up to be thousands of dollars per year.While its not mandatory, you might want to purchase a Medigap policy to fill some of the gaps in Medicare Part A and/or Part B. (Medigap doesnt work with Medicare Advantage policies.)DEDUCTIBLESMedicare Part A has a deductible of $1,632 in 2024, which you owe before Medicare starts to pay for inpatient hospital care.Just one hospital stay, youre going to be paying that $1,632 deductible  so, really fast, your costs can add up, says Joanne Giardini-Russell, CEO of Giardini Medicare, an independent insurance agency.Most Medigap plans cover the Part A deductible. And plans with premiums below $136 per month could put you ahead based on that benefit alone.(New Medicare members cant buy Medigap plans that cover Part Bs relatively smaller deductible of $240 in 2024, so youd still owe that amount out of pocket.)COINSURANCE AND COPAYSAfter youve met your deductible, there are out-of-pocket costs for many Medicare services. For example, you pay a 20% coinsurance for most medically necessary outpatient services covered by Part B.Medicare Part A copays kick in after your 60th day in the hospital. They start at $408 per day in 2024 and get more expensive for longer stays.All Medigap policies include at least some coverage for Part A and Part B coinsurance and copays. If you use a lot of health care, that coverage could mean big out-of-pocket savings.OUT-OF-POCKET LIMITSUnlike many other kinds of insurance, Medicare Part A and Part B dont have maximum out-of-pocket caps. Theres no limit on what you could owe as copays and coinsurance add up.Story continuesOriginal Medicare without Medigap would be perilous because we need Medigap for the out-of-pocket limit, Michael Dayoub, a certified financial planner in Savannah, Georgia, said in an email.Buying a Medigap policy is one way to put a cap on your yearly costs. Paying more upfront for premiums could pay off by limiting your future out-of-pocket spending.IS MEDIGAP WORTH THE COST?You can expect to pay $100-$150 per month or more for the most popular Medigap plan, Plan G, when you sign up at age 65. And premiums can go up based on plan type, age, location and sometimes health status.Thats a significant added expense  so is it worth it?Giardini-Russell compares Medigap to car insurance, which you pay for each month, even though you hope not to need it. It comes down a lot of times to the psychology and peace of mind, she says. Are you willing to pay $150 per month for peace of mind?We tend to hear from beneficiaries that they are very satisfied with their policy, Greiner said. Medigap is worth it if you can afford to pay the Medigap premiums along with your premiums for Medicare Part B and a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, according to Greiner.If Medigap isnt affordable, you might want to look into programs that can help with Medicare costs, such as Medicare Savings Programs and Extra Help subsidies.People who cant afford Medigap premiums could also consider Medicare Advantage, according to Dayoub. Medicare Advantage plans are bundled alternatives to Original Medicare sold by private insurance companies. They have out-of-pocket limits, but there are trade-offs to consider, such as limited provider networks.ENROLLMENT TIME LIMITSThe best and easiest time to buy a Medigap policy is right as youre turning 65. Your six-month Medigap open enrollment period starts when youre 65 and enrolled in Medicare Part B.During this period, insurance companies cant use medical underwriting to charge you more or deny coverage based on your health or medical history. After that, it can be more expensive or even impossible to get a Medigap policy.So if you want to buy in for peace of mind, dont miss your best chance. You can compare options on Medicare.gov, shop online or work with an agent or broker to find the best policy for you.______________________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

Chinese Billionaire Is Second-Biggest Foreign Owner of US LandLithium  the ultra-light metal used in electric-vehicle batteries  has plunged more than 80% from a late-2022 record, as the market whiplashed from shortage fears to a mountain of surplus inventories. Nickel and cobalt have also tumbled, weighed down by an influx of new production amid concerns that the shift to EVs may not be as smooth and quick as predicted.Its a dramatic reversal from the ebullience of recent years that sent prices soaring and sparked a rush by some of the auto industrys biggest players to secure future supply. Now, carmakers are getting cold feet and abandoning deal discussions, according to mining investment bankers and industry executives. The low prices are making it harder for mine builders to raise money from more traditional sources as well, at a time when the industry is also grappling with rampant inflation driving up the cost to build new projects.Chemaf Resources Ltd. last year put itself up for sale after a slump in the cobalt price left it struggling to finish key projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and London-based Horizonte Minerals Plc scaled back work on its Brazilian nickel mine as it searches for funds to complete construction, and announced an emergency $20 million financing late last year.Junior producers have been particularly hard hit. Australias Core Lithium Ltd. said last week it would halt mining operations at its Grants open pit mine until conditions improve, warning of a writedown, while nickel miner Panoramic Resources Ltd. is suspending its flagship mine after entering voluntary administration late last year when it failed to find a buyer or partner.Story continuesThe turmoil is likely to have long-term ramifications for supply, and stands in stark contrast to the growing emphasis by governments on securing future access to critical minerals.Building new mines takes years and sometimes decades, and stalled projects can often be hard to restart. And while most crucial battery markets are now in surplus, shortages are already forecast toward the end of the decade as the greening of the economy accelerates.In the case of lithium  a once-tiny commodity market that has been catapulted into the global spotlight due to its vital role in EV batteries  the extreme boom and bust of the last few years shows the difficulties in trying to forecast future supply-demand balances and prices, for both producers and their investors.Theres nothing magical about EV input markets like lithium and cobalt"

Yahoo Finance,"The housing market is heading for the affordability of 2 years ago, Morgan Stanley says. Heres why its home price forecast is unchanged",2024-01-09,0.555556,"Morgan Stanleys home price outlook is unchanged, but it does see something new in affordability, after a painful year for most homebuyers, as mortgage rates bit in a way they havent
since the 1980s
. James Egan, the banks co-head of U.S. securities products research, crunched the data on mortgage rates falling from their recent 8% peak to the 6% range, and sees affordability improving as early as next month to a point unseen since February 2021, which was less than halfway through the pandemic housing boom.This is needed since home prices have once again broken through to a new record high, the note said. Egan and his team cited data showing Octobers year-over-year increase of 4.8%. The catch, they say, is that mortgage rates decreased more than 50 basis points in December and close to 70 basis points the prior month. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is sitting at 6.8%much lower than Octobers 23-year high, but more than double the 3% range that put a floor under the pandemic era housing boom.Mortgage rates will also support Morgan Stanleys forecast from November, which sees prices mildly declining through 2024. While home prices continue to climb, as these lower rates filter through our affordability calculations the pace of deterioration has slowed to its most benign levels since 2Q21, the banks strategists wrote. If rates were to hold at these levels, [year-over-year] affordability could improve as soon as next monthwhich would be the first time this has been the case since February 2021.It is our expectation of increases here that has us continuing to expect a mild decrease in home prices in 2024 despite improved affordability and the growth in sales, the strategists wrote. In late November, the investment bank
forecast
a 3% drop in nationwide home prices through this year.If current mortgage rates were to hold, the strategists added, the monthly mortgage payment on a median-priced home would be $185 lower than Morgan Stanleys existing metric. That would bring the average monthly payment to its lowest level since April. Nonetheless, affordability has already improved some.Story continuesThe bank found that pending home sales and mortgage purchase applications remain soft, but the pace of their decline has moderated significantly, the note read, citing a 15% year-over-year decline in purchase applications and a 5% decline in pending home sales last month. But the investment bank predicts sales to increase this year, with existing-home sales jumping 2.5% year over year, and new-home sales 7.5%.While a faster improvement in affordability than we expected introduces upside risk to our forecastswe expect the absolute levels of affordability and inventory to keep growth from accelerating too quickly, they wrote.Existing-home sales
retreated to their slowest pace in more than a decadelargely a result of the lock-in effect, which refers to homeowners refusing to sell their homes for fear of losing their low mortgage rates. More than 90% of conventional borrowers have a mortgage rate less than or equal to 6%; nearly 87% have a rate less than or equal to 5%; almost 75% have a rate less than or equal to 4%, according to Morgan Stanley.However, the lock-in effect seems to be showing signs of easing, as existing-home sales rose in November after five consecutive monthly declines. Theyre still down more than 7% on an annual basis, and new-home sales are only up more than 1% year over year. But it is expected that supply will increase this year. For-sale inventory was virtually unchanged, in December, following seven consecutive months of declines. Months of supply, which refers to the number of months it would take for all the current homes for sale on the market to sell, has also increased to its highest level since May 2020, the note said.This story was originally featured on

He pointed out that the ""Magnificent Seven"" technology stocks that led the market's charge last year have ""gone dead sideways"" since July, signaling a shift in momentum.Gundlach underscored that the US stock market hasn't trounced its international rivals in the past couple of years, suggesting it isn't the ""world beater"" it once was.

He said a recession looks highly probable, as the

declining for a while
, and employers hanging on to workers has caused a ""backup"" in the unemployment rate that could cause it to ""go vertical"" once the slowdown strikes.Gundlach called out excessive public spending as well. It has caused the national debt to balloon, he said, exacerbating the federal government's headache of debt payments eating up more and more of its revenues due to higher interest rates.""We're going to have a problem here,"" he said.

Yahoo Finance,The SEC just approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Here's what investors should know.,2024-01-10,0.555556,"The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday granted approval to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, backed by Wall Street, a key regulatory step expected to drive significant investment in the digital currency.The agency gave the green light to multiple financial firms to offer spot bitcoin ETFs, including asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Franklin Templeton that cater to retail investors. Until now, only bitcoin futures ETFs had SEC approval. Bitcoin prices have shot up on the SEC's approval of the ETFs, more than doubling since last year, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index
shows.
Prices for the cryptocurrency had already risen 61% since October on expectations that the SEC planned to grant approval of spot ETF applications, CoinDesk
reported.Here's what to know about spot bitcoin ETFs.What's an ETF?ETFs are pooled investments, like a mutual fund, but that trade on stock exchanges like a stock or bond and that track a specific index, sector or asset class.A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF. Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency

Yahoo Finance,SEC ends crypto drama by giving the green light to 11 bitcoin ETFs,2024-01-10,0.222222,"The moment the crypto world wanted finally happened Wednesday. And this time it was for real.Regulators on Wednesday gave money managers the green light to launch 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, allowing everyday investors to get exposure to the worlds largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.The ETFs, which begin trading Thursday, could make bitcoin a potential staple in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans and give it mainstream acceptance.The Securities and Exchange Commission made the announcement roughly 24 hours after a fake social media post claimed those approvals had already been granted.The chaos triggered by that unauthorized post on X reverberated from Wall Street to Washington while attracting new scrutiny to the SEC, a longtime foe of the industry that is still in the middle of a widespread crackdown on some of cryptos major players.The price of bitcoin seesawed Tuesday and Wednesday as investors tried to make sense of the mishap, which erased tens of billions in market value in just minutes.SEC Chair Gary Gensler made it clear in a statement Wednesday that his agency ""did not approve or endorse bitcoin"" when it signed off on the new products and called Wednesday's announcement ""the most sustainable path forward"" following a key court defeat on this issue last summer.""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,"" he said in his statement.Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. (Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS)
(REUTERS / Reuters)One SEC commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw, published a dissenting opinion that called the agency's actions ""unsound and ahistorical.""""I am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of US households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets,"" she said in her statement.The SEC has rejected such applications in the past, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation.Story continuesThe list of applicants approved by the SEC Wednesday included some of the biggest names on Wall Street, from BlackRock (
BLK
) to Franklin Templeton (
BEN
), as well as a number of firms better known in the crypto world.These issuers competed with one another in the run-up to their launches to offer the lowest fees, hoping to attract as many investors as possible once ETFs begin trading.Other big Wall Street players plan to be part of the action, as well. JPMorgan Chase (
JPM
) and Goldman Sachs (
GS
) are among the giant banks that have offered to help some of these money managers create and redeem shares of their new funds.Optimism about these approvals helped bitcoin

(Lucas Jackson/REUTERS)
(REUTERS / Reuters)Since then, the SEC has denied more than 30 similar applications.A key turnaround moment came last year in June when the worlds biggest money manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The interest from one of Wall Streets biggest names sparked other asset managers to follow suit.Another important development came last August when one of the ETF applicants, Grayscale Investments, won a key legal victory over the SEC. Grayscale had sued the SEC in 2022 after it wasn't allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (
GBTC
) into a spot bitcoin offering.Its core argument was that the agency had already approved exchange-traded products that held bitcoin futures contracts and thus had ""acted arbitrarily and capriciously.""A three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington sided with Grayscale, saying the firm had ""advanced substantial evidence"" its product was similar to bitcoin futures ETFs previously approved by the SEC.That forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscales spot bitcoin ETF application, along with others filed by rival money managers.""We are now faced with a new set of filings similar to those we have disapproved in the past,"" Gensler said in his statement Wednesday. ""Circumstances, however, have changed.""One of the applicants, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, told Yahoo Finance that the dominant providers of spot bitcoin ETFs will be those that take in the most money from investors right out of the gate.The winners ""will be a few and it will be the most liquid,"" she said.Cathie Wood, ARK Investment Management's CEO. (David Swanson/REUTERS)
(REUTERS / Reuters)Historically, launches for other bitcoin products have sent bitcoins price on a wild ride.It happened in 2017 with the launch of the countrys first bitcoin futures contracts and then in 2021 with the SECs approval of the first bitcoin futures ETFs. Prices soared and then fell by large amounts in the year following the launches.In recent weeks, much debate has raged over whether bitcoin will rise or fall once the lauded moment of approval comes to pass.Gautam Chhugani, managing director of the research arm for Bernstein, said his team estimates such financial products will garner $10 billion or more in investment flows through the end of 2024 and ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" over a two-year period.That, he added, will help push bitcoins price even higher.""We do think that bitcoin goes to $150,000 by 2025,"" Chhugani added.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.Click here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

""Remember, we won't ask you to do the same amount of work with fewer people, so adjust plans accordingly.""While Salesforce had a hiring freeze last year from October 2022 to January 2023, this hiring freeze doesn't have an anticipated end date, according to the memo.

laid off 10% of its staff
after hasty pandemic hiring followed by an economic downturn.""Our job is to grow the company and to continue to achieve great margins,"" Benioff told Bloomberg in an interview at the time.

in a cost-cutting measure.Story continuesThis freeze comes as a surprise to some, especially
after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff extended job offers
to OpenAI employees in November, promising to match their current salaries after the temporary removal of OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman.""The good news is that we've made a ton of hires over the last six months.

According to preliminary results by Gartner, PC shipments increased for the first time in eight straight quarters in the fourth quarter of 2023.For the quarter, the industry shipped a total of 63.3 million units, eking out a meager 0.3% increase over the same period last year. All totaled, the industry moved 241.8 million PCs, a 14.8% overall decline, and the first time that shipments have fallen below 250 million units since 2006, Gartner said.The PC market has hit the bottom of its decline after significant adjustment, Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa wrote in a release. Inventory was normalized in the fourth quarter of 2023, which had been an issue plaguing the industry for two years. This subtle growth suggests that demand and supply are finally balanced.Intel's Open House at the Consumer Electronic Show on Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. (Jeff Bottari/AP Images for Intel)
(ASSOCIATED PRESS)But Kitagawa warned that balance might be short-lived as economic and geopolitical volatility could upend the PC markets return to growth. While the PC market picked up in Q4, the global market is still fraught with pockets of weakness. In particular China has proven to be stubbornly slow to recover.Overall, Gartner said Greater China pulled down results for the Asia Pacific region, which saw shipments decline as much as 8%. The EMEA region saw the biggest jump in growth, with shipments rising 8.7%. North America shipments also increased.The turnaround, however slight, comes at an important time for the PC industry, as Microsoft, chipmakers, and PC manufacturers push the concept of the AI PC as the next major growth opportunity for laptop and desktop PCs.AI PCs are loosely defined as PCs outfitted with some kind of neural processor capable of running AI programs natively. Nvidia (

MSFT
) in particular is keen on adding AI capabilities to consumers devices, with the launch of its AI-powered Windows Copilot on Windows systems and the inclusion of a Copilot key on Windows laptop and desktop keyboards.Story continuesSign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.
(Yahoo Finance)Industry watchers largely expect 2024 to serve as a kind of rebound period for the PC industry as the laptops and desktops consumers and businesses purchased at the onset of the pandemic in 2020 begin to age out of usefulness. As the world began to shut down, millions set out to purchase PCs to be able to work and play while on lockdown.As a result, sales of PCs fell off of a cliff as consumers and businesses had little reason to upgrade in the intervening years. But as those systems begin to become outdated, demand is picking up again.That will help a litany of companies outside of PC makers, including chip manufacturers, memory makers, and other component builders. Intel (

Investing.com,2023 Corporate Bankruptcies Topped Pandemic Year Numbers,2024-01-11,0.222222,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
There were more corporate bankruptcies in 2023 than there were during the pandemic of 2020.
Higher interest rates and massive levels of corporate debt drove the flurry of business failures last year.
There were 642 corporate bankruptcy filings in the U.S. in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That was a 72.6 percent increase over the 2022 total and the largest number of bankruptcy filings since 2010.What caused the big surge in bankruptcies in 2023?
You can blame the Federal Reserve.
Simply put, the U.S. economy cannot function long-term in a high interest rate environment. Easy money is gone and companies are struggling to survive without that mothers milk.
The central bank drove interest rates from zero to 5.5 percent in a relatively short period of time to fight price inflation. But the real problems started long before the rate hiking cycle.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed pushed dropped interest rates to zero and held them there for nearly a decade. It didnt start trying to normalize rates in earnest until 2017, and it failed miserably. In the fall of 2018, the economy started getting wobbly and the stock market crashed. The Fed paused rate hikes in December 2018 and cut rates three times the following year. The pandemic gave the central bank the excuse it needed to slash rates back to zero in 2020.
Other central banks followed the Feds lead. More than a decade of easy money had a predictable effect. Corporations, governments, and individuals ran up mountains of debt."

Especially, the shelter costs increased by more than 6%. But if you dont count food and energy price inflation, core inflation eased to 3.9% during the same month. And well, if you start getting the shelter cost off the calculation, the numbers were quite good. Of course, the metrics that disregard food, energy, and shelter prices  like the core and supercore inflation  make little sense to Mr. and Ms. Everyone, as everyone eats, everyone uses energy and everyone needs shelter. Yet, for the Federal Reserve (Fed), these items have volatile prices, so they prefer looking past these important categories. While doing so, inflation eased. Also, note that a rise in car prices also added to the inflationary pressures last month. But their weight is lower in the calculation of the PCE index. Thats why the Feds favorite inflation gauge  the PCE index which will be released by the end of the month - will likely be trending closer to the 2% target.But all in all, yesterdays inflation report was less than ideal, and the market reaction was mixed. The US
2-year
and
10-year
first rose then fell, whereas you would expect a swift shift in dovish Fed expectations following a bigger-than-expected jump in US headline inflation. The equities were up and down, and the
S&P 500
closed the session very slightly in the negative while the
Nasdaq
eked out even a small gain at yesterdays close.Disinflation remains the base case scenario for this year, housing costs are expected to fall  at some point  and that could counterweight the rising shipping costs caused by the Red Sea tensions and low water levels in the Panama Canal that also threaten food deflation that we saw last year. Yet some hawkish voices are rising at the Fed, at the start of this year. Feds Loretta Mester said that its probably too early to cut rates. Mr. Barkin also repeated that hes looking for more evidence that inflation is headed toward the 2% target.But its obvious that investors are not willing to trade the bad smell for now.The
US Dollar Index
is under pressure after yet a stronger-than-expected inflation report, the
EUR/USD
rebounded lower after hitting the 1.10 mark, as the euro bulls, or the
dollar
bears found no reasonable conviction to carry the rally above the 1.10 mark, and gold rebounded after hitting the 50-DMA, near $2013 per ounce. Activity on Fed funds futures still gives more than 70% chance for the first Fed rate hike to happen in March. But the Fed wont find enough evidence that inflation will ease toward the 2% target as early as March. Consequently, there should be a readjustment in market expectations, and we will see the stock and bond prices make a corrective move to the downside.Over the next few weeks, attention will be directed toward company earnings, and we will start digesting the earnings starting from the financial sector. The SPDRs financials closed last year with more than a 20% rally thanks to optimism that the Fed would start cutting the interest rates sooner rather than later. The massive rebound in US long-term papers had a substantial positive impact on their balance sheets. Yet expectations for the US banks are not necessarily positive. First, the banks are expected to announce a 21% decline in their profits compared to the same period last year, as a result of higher costs to attract and maintain deposits in an environment of high inflation and higher Fed rates. Then, credit card delinquencies continue to rise. US consumer spending remained robust yet people are not buying stuff that they can afford. The bad loans are therefore expected to be on the rise. On the corporate side, investment banking revenues will likely remain weak given that the M&A activity was subdued last year. And well, if the Fed starts cutting the interest rates and the economy slows, the banks will start seeing their net profit margin shrink. Therefore, the FactSet projections indicate that the S&P 500s financial sector could reveal the4th highest yoy earnings decline among all 11 sectors for Q4, with an estimated downturn of -3.1%. If thats the case, a correction in the S&P 500 financials would only make sense after a more than 20% rally recorded in just two months. Anyway, I stop here and let the bank earnings tell the story.In energy,
crude oil
rebounded 2% yesterday and is better bid this morning on the back of rising tensions in the Red Sea. This time the news that Iran captured an oil tanker off the coast of Oman is pushing prices higher. Yet the Red Sea tensions have so far been insufficient to push the price of a barrel sustainably higher. Therefore, price rallies into and above the $75pb level could be interesting top-selling opportunities for those willing to see the price of a barrel fall below the $70pb level.On the corporate level, consolidation in the US energy sector is now shifting toward the nat gas companies.

Investing.com,EUR/USD  US CPI No Game-Changer for Interest Rate Expectations,2024-01-12,0.666667,"The CPI report has become a source of good news for investors, as inflation has fallen sharply to within touching distance of the Federal Reserves 2% target. The last step may be the hardest, as many have warned, but investors are clearly of the view that the hard work has been done and its only a matter of time until rates are falling.Todays report was not expected to be a game-changer, with forecasts pointing to only marginal moves in December and thats exactly what we got. Unfortunately, the surprises came in the wrong direction which is whats knocked sentiment in early trade on Wall Street.Ultimately, it doesnt really change anything and interest rate expectations are broadly as they were. Theres plenty more to come between now and March that will dictate whether that meeting is as live as markets are currently positioned for.Jobless claims were no more inspiring, barely changed from a week ago, and marginally lower than expected. Continuing claims were slightly lower but the trend remains as it was. Layoffs are low but the trend in continuing claims is higher, suggesting few are losing their jobs but those that are, are struggling to find new work. Perhaps not the weakness the Fed expected to see but maybe enough to get inflation back to 2%.Before the release,
EUR/USD
was flirting with 1.10 again and, in part due to the release, it failed to break above here before trading lower on the day.Source  OANDAWhile this could be viewed as a bearish signal, the recent trend remains bullish since the October lows and the rebound off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level last week supported this. Another failure at 1.10 may weaken that position but only a break below 1.0882 would suggest the trend has changed.Original Post"

Investing.com,"Despite Higher-Than-Expected CPI, Trend of Easing Inflation Persists",2024-01-11,0.555556,"In December, the
consumer price index
(CPI) in the United States rose by 3.4% year-over-year (YoY), marking the highest increase in three months, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).As expected, the hotter-than-expected print led to a cautious response in the financial markets.The concern stems from the CPI climbing more than expected in December, prompting speculation that the Federal Reserve might maintain its hawkish interest-rate stance for a longer duration than previously anticipated.In December, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.3% month-over-month (MoM), surpassing the median estimate of 0.2% from 68 economists, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg.On a year-over-year basis, the CPI rose by 3.4%, exceeding the estimated 3.2%. The core CPI, excluding food and energy, also rose by 0.3% MoM, meeting expectations. On a YoY basis, the core CPI increased by 3.9%, slightly higher than the estimated 3.8%.Notable changes include a 0.2% increase in the food index, a 0.4% increase in the energy index, and a 0.5% rise in the shelter index. Owners' equivalent rent of residence increased by 0.5% in December, contributing to a 6.3% year-over-year increase.According to BLS, the shelter index experienced a continued rise, contributing to more than half of the overall monthly increase in all items. The energy index increase was driven by higher electricity and gasoline indexes, offsetting a decline in the
natural gas
index.The food index increase mirrored the previous month. Food at home increased by 0.1%, while food away from home rose by 0.3%. The index for all items, excluding food and energy, also rose by 0.3% in December, matching the previous month's increase.Categories such as shelter, motor vehicle insurance, and medical care showed increases, while household furnishings and operations, along with personal care, decreased. The energy index decreased by 2% over the 12 months ending December, while the food index increased by 2.7% over the same period.A separate press release from BLS showed that real average hourly earnings for all employees saw a 0.2% increase in December. This growth is attributed to a 0.4% rise in average hourly earnings, coupled with a 0.3% increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.However, real average weekly earnings experienced a 0.2% decline during the same period, driven by the change in real average hourly earnings and a 0.3% reduction in the average workweek. On a yearly basis, from December 2022 to December 2023, real average hourly earnings witnessed a 0.8% increase, seasonally adjusted.The change in real average hourly earnings, combined with a 0.3% decrease in the average workweek, contributed to a 0.5% growth in real average weekly earnings over this twelve-month period.Thursdays CPI report came in slightly higher than anticipated, fueling bets that the Federal Reserve may not start cutting rates until at least May this year. However, it is noteworthy that the trend of easing inflation persists, supported by several leading indicators pointing towards softness.Unemployment claims remain low, reflecting subdued temporary seasonal hiring in November and December. These data releases imply a potential temporary increase in Treasury yields and inflation expectations, while a more prolonged move could definitely hurt
stocks
.Futures traders maintained a significant likelihood of the Fed initiating interest rate cuts in March. The CME Group's FedWatch gauge indicated a 63% probability of a reduction in March, slightly down from the previous day. This probability underscores a divergence in expectations between the market and the Fed regarding the timing and extent of rate cuts in 2024.The investment banking giant UBS said earlier this week that it expects the Fed to cut rates by 100 basis points this year.Inflation strengthened as 2023 concluded, with the CPI rising 0.3% in December from the previous month and 3.4% from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department. This marks an acceleration from November's 0.1% monthly gain and 3.1% annual increase. Thursdays print has fueled uncertainty surrounding the Feds next moves with the central banks officials now likely to push back against expected rate cuts in March.***Shane Neagle is the EIC of The Tokenist.

retirement
is a common practice for people entering their golden years. While profits from a home sale are considered capital gains, the IRS typically allows you to exclude part of the profit  if not all of it  from your taxes.But what if you sold your home and pocketed as much as $640,000?

Yahoo Finance,"Rental giant Hertz dumps EVs, including Teslas, for gas cars",2024-01-11,0.666667,"By Nathan Gomes and Joseph White(Reuters) -Rental firm Hertz Global Holdings is selling about 20,000 electric vehicles, including Teslas, from its U.S. fleet about two years after a deal with the automaker to offer its vehicles for rent, in another sign that EV demand has cooled.Hertz will instead opt for gas-powered vehicles, it said on Thursday, citing higher expenses related to collision and damage for EVs even though it had aimed to convert 25% of its fleet to electric by 2024 end.CEO Stephen Scherr had last year at the JPMorgan Auto Conference flagged headwinds from higher expenses for its EVs, particularly Teslas.Hertz even limited the torque and speed on the EVs and offered it to experienced users on the platform to make them easier to adapt after certain users had front-end collisions, he said.Shares of the company, which also operates vehicles from Swedish EV maker Polestar among others, fell about 4%. Tesla's stock was down about 3%.Hertz also expects about $245 million in charges related to depreciation expenses from the EV sale in the fourth quarter of 2023.BUMPY ROAD FOR EV GROWTHIts decision underscores the bumpy road EVs have hit as their sales growth slows, causing carmakers like General Motors and Ford to scale back production plans.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note Hertz's move was another sign that EV expectations need to be ""reset downward"".While consumers enjoy the driving experience and fuel savings (per mile) of an EV, Jonas said there are other ""hidden costs to EV ownership"".""Expenses related to collision and damage, primarily associated with EVs, remained high in the quarter,"" Hertz said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.The company, which had earlier planned to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by 2022 end and 65,000 units from Polestar over five years, said it would focus on improving profitability for the rest of its EV fleet.German rental car company Sixt said in December it had not purchased Tesla vehicles since 2022 and was selling its fleet of Teslas ""as part of our regular de-fleeting process"".Story continuesIt still plans to offer a range of electrified vehicles and ""stick to our goal to electrify 70-90 percent of our rental fleet in Europe by 2030"", it said on Thursday.USED-EV PRICES DROPMeanwhile, wholesale used-EV prices fell for most of 2023 as prices for new EVs fell and inventories of unsold electric vehicles rose, according to Cox Automotive data.Cox forecast before Hertz's decision that used-EV prices would decline more than overall used vehicle prices in 2024.""While 20,000 cars isn't a large number in the total used vehicle market, it does mean Hertz will be taking a major loss on each of these sales while further contributing to the trend of falling used EV values,"" iSeeCars.com analyst Karl Brauer said.Hertz is selling some Tesla Model 3 for as low as about $20,000, nearly half the purchase price for the cheapest variant of the compact sedan, its used car website showed.It lists more than 700 EVs on sale, including BMW's i3, Chevrolet's Bolt and Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y SUVs.(Reporting by Nathan Gomes and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, Joe White in Detroit; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar, Sriraj Kalluvila and Arun Koyyur)"

Yahoo Finance,Amazon layoffs show Big Tech is still coming down from pandemic highs,2024-01-11,0.222222,"The COVID-era spending spree is over. And the tech layoffs keep coming.Amazon (
AMZN
) is eliminating several hundred roles across
Prime Video and MGM Studios
, according to a memo sent to staff on Wednesday. And the company's video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, announced it is
laying off more than 500 people
.That Amazon is ringing in the new year with
another round of cuts
highlights the tech sector's climb down from COVID-era expansion. Even as confidence grows on Wall Street that the economy will finally break free from fears of a recession, tech companies are still
reeling from heady staffing days
and
ambitious investments
made during the early stages of the pandemic.During the acute phase of the public health crisis, company ranks swelled alongside aspirations of rapid growth and a tech-centric transformation. Many executives and market observers believed new consumer habits would redefine the trends to come and accelerate changes already on the way. Screen time exploded as social lives shrunk and adapted. But the spike in demand for e-commerce and digital services eventually leveled off, leaving executives with what they claimed were bloated teams and inefficiency. A brutal wave of job cuts was their answer.""A lot of companies in various sectors of the economy had rapid expansion during the 'stay at home economy,'"" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. ""Amazon is taking steps to narrow the gap between employee headcount and the growth of its business.""Amazon was arguably the darling of the pandemic era as it benefited from consumers sudden shift to online shopping and businesses broad move to the cloud, said Nicole Tanenbaum, partner and chief investment strategist at Chequers Financial Management. During this period, Amazons profitability soared while the company boosted staffing and leaned into expanded offerings and markets. Amazons headcount grew by 310,000 from
2020
to
2021
, an increase of almost 25%.Story continuesBut as the disruptions of the pandemic eased into a recovering economy,
the companys prior investment decisions collided with slowing revenue growth, a reset in consumer spending patterns, and increasing cost pressures triggered by historic inflation.Amazon also faced a major leadership transition. Jeff Bezos, the companys founder, whose identity is intimately tied to the company, stepped aside as CEO in 2021. Andy Jassy, the head of Amazons lucrative and industry-leading cloud service, AWS, then took the reins.Not only does Jassy take a much more direct approach with regards to regulatory and political issues, he has not been afraid to admit that the company overbuilt and needed to reset its approach, lasering in on efforts to control margins and operations in the face of significant inflationary pressures, Tanenbaum said.Amazon is cutting several hundred positions across its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)
(ASSOCIATED PRESS)For Jassy and Amazon, rightsizing the business arrived in the form of substantial cost-cutting initiatives. The company enacted stark headcount reductions along with a hiring freeze to further control costs.Amazon's layoffs over the last several years amount to more than 27,000 cuts. The latest round underscores the financial pullback, especially in contrast to massive spending during peak COVID. For instance,
Amazon spent $8.5 billion to acquire MGM, the home of James Bond, in 2022. And the company is estimated to have doled out
more than $1 billion to produce multiple seasons of
The Rings of Power
,
its
Lord of the Rings
prequel series, and likely the most expensive show ever.While Amazon is among the largest private employers in the US, and the biggest within the tech world, several of its industry peers have turned to drastic layoffs. Meta (
META
) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, dubbed 2023 the ""
year of efficiency
."" The social media company cut more than 20,000 jobs since late 2022 to cope with declining ad revenue and to improve the business and its cost structure.And Google (
GOOG
,
GOOGL
), which has cut more than 10,000 jobs in that period, said
on Thursday it is laying off hundreds of workers
on its digital assistant, hardware, and engineering teams, as the search giant aims to trim costs and focus on its biggest priorities.There is a chance Big Tech will bolster its ranks if the Fed starts to cut rates later this year, relaxing the more reserved posture the industry has adopted. But whats happening now to staff levels suggests otherwise, said Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. After peaking in the spring of 2022, tech industry headcounts suffered a significant decline through the summer of last year. Those losses eventually flattened out and leveled off, a trend thats likely to continue, as exuberance gives way to caution.The digital lives of consumers changed during the pandemic  that's undeniable. But they continue to change, along with the next chapter of the US economy.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on Twitter

Typically, only one fund that tracks a new asset class begins trading on a single day. Its unprecedented to see over 10 nearly identical funds all begin at once. But even singling in on one ETF indicates the sheer magnitude of trading.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was the most heavily traded ETF debut on record. To be sure, the product has existed in its trust structure since 2013, and had a nearly $27 billion headstart in asset size.Trading volume doesnt indicate buying or selling or investor inflows. Because of the way the funds settle trades, net flows into or out of the products probably wont be known until at least Friday.When the initial Bitcoin futures fund began trading in 2021, it saw turnover of almost $1 billion during the entire first day. At the time, the futures fund debut was the second-most heavily traded fund on record.Story continuesPsarofagis added a caveat that much of the demand may be from so called seed money that is pre-arranged by the fund issuers. Signs of more organic demand, like from retail investors or financial advisors, may come later on as more broker-dealers list the funds on their platforms.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerbergs Top Priority

But excluding volatile food and energy costs the pace of price increases fell to 3.9% from 4%, showing ongoing moderation in underlying price pressures.It was an ambiguous outcome at a time when Fed officials are looking for some final but convincing bits of evidence that the pandemic-era spike in inflation has dissipated to the degree they can begin easing monetary policy and begin reducing the benchmark interest rate.The December CPI report ""just shows there is more work to do and that work is going to take restrictive monetary policy,"" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.""I think we need to see more evidence,"" before reducing interest rates, she said, with a March rate cut, currently anticipated by financial markets, ""too early in my estimation.""In separate comments to reporters following a presentation at the Virginia Bankers Association, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the December inflation report was ""about as expected,"" with prices rising slowly for goods but shelter and services costs still increasing at a more vigorous pace.Barkin said that did not add to the sort of ""conviction"" about future declines in inflation that he feels he would need to begin reducing the Fed's target interest rate.""This gap between services and shelter and goods is one that I am watching carefully because you would not want a goods deflationary cycle to end and find yourself disproportionately bearing the cost of shelter and services,"" Barkin said.Story continuesWhile noting the progress the Fed has seen in inflation this year, with some measures close to the central bank's 2% target over the past six months, ""you'd have even more reassurance...if it were broader based"" and included a slower pace of price increases for services and housing costs, Barkin said.The Fed is expected to hold its policy rate steady at the upcoming Jan. 30-31 meeting, but financial markets anticipate rate cuts will begin in March.(Reporting by Howard Schneider and Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

Investing.com,Biden Admin. Runs Half Trillion Dollar Deficit in Q1 of Fiscal 2024,2024-01-12,0.222222,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Just one quarter into fiscal 2024, the federal government has already run a budget deficit of over half a trillion dollars.
The December budget shortfall came in at $129.37 billion, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That drove the 2024 deficit to $509.94 billion. Thats a 21 percent increase over the first quarter deficit in fiscal 2023.
This follows on the heels of the third-largest annual budget deficit in history (1.7 trillion).
These massive monthly budget shortfalls are pushing the national debt higher at a dizzying pace. On December 29, the national debt eclipsed $34 trillion for the first time. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5, the national debt stood at a ""mere"" $31.46 trillion.President Joe Biden blames Republican tax cuts under the Trump administration for the ever-widening budget deficit, but the numbers dont bear this out. Federal receipts were just under $1.1 trillion in the first quarter. Thats 12 percent higher than through the first three months of fiscal 2023.
Federal revenue did decline in fiscal 2023 after a windfall in 2022. According to a Tax Foundation analysis of Congressional Budget Office data, federal tax collections were up 21 percent in fiscal 22. Tax collections also came in at a multi-decade high of 19.6 percent as a share of GDP. But at the time, CBO analysts warned the good times wouldnt last.
And they didnt.
Government receipts fell by 9.3 percent in fiscal 2023. Even so, receipts are up so far this year even as the deficit climbed.
The real problem is on the spending side of the ledger. Over the last two years, the Biden administration has blown through roughly half a trillion every single month.
Through the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the federal government spent $1.62 trillion. Thats a 12 percent increase over the first three months of last year.Excessive borrowing and spending is a bipartisan sport.
This underscores the fact that the fundamental issue isnt that the U.S. government doesnt have enough money. The fundamental problem is that the U.S. government spends too much money. Despite the pretend spending cuts, and promises from the Biden administration that it would save hundreds of billions the debt ceiling deal (aka the [misnamed]
Fiscal Responsibility Act
) didnt address that problem. No matter what you hear about spending cuts, the federal government always finds new reasons to spend more money.These big budget deficits are happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills, and it is likely one of the reasons that the Federal Reserve is talking about rate cuts even though the CPI remains well above the mythical 2 percent target. The borrow-and-spend U.S. government cant function in a high interest-rate environment.
Uncle Sam spent $288.01 billion in interest expense to finance the national debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. That was more than national defense ($238 billion) and more than Medicare ($168 billion). The only higher spending category was Social Security at $351 billion.
Net interest expense, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, was $216 billion in Q1, still nearly as much as the government spent on national defense.
Much of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month, some of that super-low-yielding paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates. The weighted average interest rate on the governments outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.17 percent as of the end of December. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.32 percent in December 2022.
Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words, the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
And it's only going to get worse.
Interest expense will continue to rise at a rapid rate as more and more Treasuries mature and are replaced by higher-yielding bonds.
The only way out of this fiscal death spiral is significant spending cuts and/or major tax hikes. Congress doesnt seem to have the political will for either."
Investing.com,The Common Definition of Inflation Is Wrong - It's Just Government Propaganda,2024-01-12,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
The Consumer Price Index for December came in hotter than expected but its a lot lower than it was a year ago. That means inflation is decreasing, right?
Not so fast.
Its important to understand that the term inflation as bandied about by government people and the mainstream financial media is vague and imprecise. The word simply means an increase. But an increase in what?When government officials and pundits on TV talk about inflation, they almost always mean price inflation. This is what the CPI attempts to measure  how much prices have generally gone up in the economy. When you hear Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell or some other government official talk about cooling inflation, theyre simply saying that prices are not rising as fast as measured by the CPI.
But historically, inflation didnt mean rising prices. Inflation was defined more precisely as an increase in the amount of money and credit in the economy, or more succinctly, an expansion in the money supply.Economist Ludwig von Mises defined it this way in his essay ""

Investing.com,Gold Rises Despite Strong US CPI Numbers; EUR/USD Briefly Touches a 10-Day High,2024-01-12,0.333333,"The gold (XAU) price gained 0.23% in a very volatile trading session on Thursday.Initially,
XAU/USD
dropped to a 1-month low as US inflation figures were higher than the forecast. However, the pair regained most of the losses during the late American trading session due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Gold traders need to take geopolitical risks into consideration. Even though the fundamental pressure on gold turned more bearish due to higher-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, the news from the Middle East about the US launching military strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen pushed XAU/USD up.The market now worries that the Federal Reserve (Fed) won't deliver a first-rate cut at the March monetary policy meeting. Indeed, Fed officials remain hawkish. For example, Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester said it would likely be too soon to cut the base rate in March. Richmond Fed chief Tom Barkin added that gains on inflation have been too narrowly focused on goods. Therefore, it seems unreasonable to expect the price of gold to increase. However, political instability in the Middle East increases gold's safe-haven appeal and supports the bullish trend in XAU/USD.Gold was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions as the US and the U.K. launched military strikes against locations linked to the Houthi movement in Yemen. Today, XAU/USD may remain volatile as traders attempt to balance between bearish fundamental data and bullish geopolitical news.

Investing.com,Decline in Full-Time Jobs Points to Rising Recession Threat,2024-01-12,0.333333,"In the most recent BLS employment report, the percentage of full-time jobs relative to the population dropped sharply.The robust headline number of 216,000 led most media commentators to suggest a
soft landing
is at hand. However, the decline in full-time employment suggests recession risks are higher than thought.To understand why such is the case, we must first review why the current economic environment remains stronger than anticipated.In mid-2023, we
discussed
how the massive monetary infusions supported economic activity, and we were experiencing a
manufacturing
recession but not an economic one.Much like in 2011-2012, the manufacturing side of the economy has been in contraction for over a year, as shown by the
ISM Manufacturing
Index.The reason such was possible is that the service sector of the U.S. economy kept the economy afloat. Unlike in the past, where manufacturing was a significant component of economic activity, today, services comprise nearly 80% of each dollar spent.This isnt the first time we have seen the manufacturing side of the economy contract, but services remained robust enough to keep the overall economy out of recession. The economy similarly avoided a 
recession
in 1998, 2011, and 2015.Lets build a composite index and economically weigh services and manufacturing to the current environment. We can more clearly see why the economy has avoided a recession.So, what does that have to do with full-time jobs?With high inflation and interest rates, how has the services side of the economy held up so well? That was a function of a tremendous amount of fiscal liquidity poured into the economy.However, as shown above, service growth has slowed as those
excess savings
ran out. In the future, wage growth and employment will be the supporting factors for economic activity, which is critical to understand.The U.S. is a consumption-based economy. However, consumers can not consume without producing something first. Production must come first to generate the income needed for that consumption. The cycle is displayed below.Of course, if you bypass the production phase of the cycle by sending checks directly to households, you will get a strong surge in economic growth.As shown in the
GDP
chart above, the massive spike in economic growth in the second quarter of 2021 directly resulted from those fiscal policies.However, once individuals spent that stimulus, the economic activity subsided as the production side of the equation was still lagging. Here is the crucial point about full-time jobs.While the media touts the strong employment reports, such is mostly the recovery of jobs lost during the economic shutdown. As shown, full-time employment as a percentage of the working-age population failed to recover to pre-pandemic levels.There are two crucial points in this data. First, the economy has NOT created millions of
new
jobs, as touted by the current administration.Secondly, relative to the working-age population, full-time jobs dropped dramatically, generally seen at the onset of recessions. Combine that with the decline in wage growth, and the potential stress on the service sector becomes more apparent.As the economy slows down, it should not be surprising that full-time jobs are declining.To protect earnings and profitability, cutting full-time jobs, the most significant expense to any business is the most efficient.While employers tend to hang on to employees as long as possible, employees eventually get sacrificed when protecting profits. As such, a reasonably predictable cycle continues until exhaustion is reached.With CEO confidence currently at levels usually associated with recession, it should be unsurprising that full-time jobs are declining.Such is particularly the case with the surge of foreign-born workers pouring into the U.S.That large pool of workers, who tend to work longer hours for less pay than native-born workers, gives companies an alternative hiring source to replace full-time with part-time workers.The alternatives for higher-skilled workers include swapping full-time employees for technological improvements, artificial intelligence, and robotics to reduce costs.As we discussed in this
article
, when faced with threats to profitability, companies will opt to reduce head counts. This was a point made in a previous report by the
Congressional Budget Office"
Investing.com,"Can We Expect More Geopolitical Turmoil, Rising Commodity Prices?",2024-01-12,0.666667,"Over the past few hundred years there has been a relationship between the extent of global military conflict and secular trends in commodity prices, with secular upward trends in commodity prices coinciding with increases in both the frequency and amplitude of military conflict. Weve covered this topic in the past, but not recently (the most recent discussion was in 2017). Due to what has happened over the past two years, this is a good time for a revisit.In his book War Cycles Peace Cycles, Richard Kelly Hoskins discussed the aforementioned relationship and presented a chart similar to the one displayed below. The chart depicts the secular trends in commodity prices over the past 260 years. Hoskins explained that most of the important military conflicts occurred during the up phases on the chart, and therefore referred to the secular commodity-price uptrends as war cycles. The secular commodity-price downtrends were termed peace cycles.A plausible explanation for why long-term advances in commodity prices are accompanied by a general increase in military conflict is that war leads to more monetary inflation, government spending, and government intervention in the economy, as well as large-scale resource wastage and supply disruptions  the perfect recipe for higher commodity prices. In addition, when structures get destroyed by war, the commodities that are embedded in these structures are destroyed and eventually get replaced as part of a rebuilding process, causing a large temporary increase in commodity demand. There is also a feedback mechanism whereby military conflict and the associated monetary inflation bring about higher commodity prices, while higher commodity prices add to international tensions and increase the probability of military conflict.A new war cycle began with the secular low for commodity prices in 1999 and has been marked, to date, by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, the nebulous War on Terror, the Arab Spring uprisings, the overthrow of Libyas government, the rise of the Islamic State organization, an initial increase in tensions between the West and Russia in 2008 related to the expansion of NATO (in particular, talk of adding Ukraine and Georgia to NATO) and culminating in the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, a long and devastating war in Yemen involving Yemeni factions and Saudi Arabia, a war in Syria, Chinas provocative expansion in the South China Sea, a further increase in tensions between the West and Russia leading to Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Israel-Hamas war that began in October-2023 and the recent Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea.At this stage, the current war cycle has lasted about 25 years, while the average length of a war cycle during the period covered by the above chart is 33 years. Therefore, the historical record indicates that if the current cycle is close to the average length then we can look forward to another 8 years or so of rising commodity prices and increasing geopolitical conflict."

(H.R.3936)recently approved by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee would temporarily boost the standard deduction by $2,000 for single filers and $4,000 for married filers for 2024 and 2025. The deduction would start to phase out for single taxpayers with $200,000 in income, or $400,000 for joint filers. A

Carol Miller, R-West Virginia, adding that the measure will increase economic activity in local economies. ""The bonus $4,000 deduction is a $100 billion tax cut for the working families and will go a long way to make sure that my constituents can make ends meet.""Potential Impact of Standard Deduction IncreaseTemporary Tax Plan Could Boost Your Standard Deduction By Up to $4,000Nearly two-thirds of households would get a tax cut in 2024 under the proposal, according to research from the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model. However, since thestandard deduction lowers the amount of income subject to tax, the deduction isn't refundable and wouldn't provide cash to lower-income taxpayers. In fact, only a small percentage of the bottom 20% of households have enough income to get a tax cut under the proposal, the researchers from Penn concluded.But those at the very top of the income ladder also wouldn't see significant tax savings if the bill becomes law. Not only does the higher deduction phase out for incomes of $200,000 or more (or $400,000 for married couples), but a larger proportion of high-income households use
itemized deductions
.""The poorest fifth of Americans would receive just 2% of the benefits of this provision, and on average, that means a tax break of just $30 next year,"" said Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the committee's ranking Democrat.Story continuesThe change would also cost approximately $96 billion over 10 years, the Penn researchers found.The standard deduction for 2023 will be $13,850 for singles and $27,700 for couples. The deduction nearly doubled as part of the 2017
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
, which expires in 2026. An increasing number of taxpayers have opted to claim the standard deduction, rather than itemize deductions for
mortgage
interest, charitable donations, medical costs and a host of other deductible expenses. According to the IRS, 90% of taxpayers opted for the standard deduction for their 2021 taxes.Will it Help Ease Inflation or Make it Worse?Temporary Tax Plan Could Boost Your Standard Deduction By Up to $4,000Sponsors of the temporary increase said the measure was intended to provide relief from
inflation
, which soared to 9.1% last June before dropping to 4% in May. The target inflation rate for the Federal Reserve is 2%, which mirrors the historical average.That reasoning was criticized in an analysis by the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, which pointed out that increasing the disposable income of so many Americans tends to make inflation worse, and would contradict efforts by the Federal Reserve to slow consumer spending by raising interest rates.Bottom LineAn increase in the standard deduction on federal income tax would benefit most U.S. households but only a small amount of lower-income taxpayers would see any cut to their tax bills. Since the increase of the standard deduction in 2017, fewer taxpayers have been itemizing deductions on their returns.Tax Optimization TipsWhen it comes to saving and investing for

You may be able to get better performance by choosing a less costly advisor or otherwise finding a lower fee rate. The key is to identify specific services you are receiving in exchange for those fees and carefully evaluate whether your portfolios performance and advisor relationship justify the costs from a mathematical and personal perspective.Do you have questions about retirement planning, tax planning or investing?
Speak with a financial advisor today
.Understanding Financial Advisor FeesAccording to a 2021 study by Advisory HQ
, the average financial advisor fee is 1.02% for $1 million in
assets under management (AUM)
as an annual fee. Advisors and firms all have their own fee schedules, though, so these can vary. This type of fee usually covers investment management, portfolio monitoring and performance reporting services, hence why theyre usually based on asset tiers. For things like financial planning and other services, hourly and fixed fees are more common, though percentage-based fees can still apply.Advisors with more years of experience, advanced expertise or special certifications like
certified financial planner (CFP)
can sometimes charge higher fees. The exact fee percentage can also typically differ depending on the overall account size and specific mix of services provided.For example, an advisor may offer a tiered fee schedule where the percentage rate decreases as asset amounts rise. In other words, on the first $1 million in a portfolio, the annual fee may be 1.2%, while assets above $2 million are charged at a rate of just 0.8%. This structure allows firms to serve clients across the wealth spectrum, while still being incentivized to help those clients continue accumulating assets.Story continuesSome advisors also customize service offerings and related fees to match a clients needs. An advisor may charge a lower percentage fee, but exclude financial planning and instead focus narrowly on
investment management
. Others may set up a comprehensive service bundle that includes financial planning, tax preparation,
estate planning
review, insurance analysis and other, more specialized offerings. In those cases, the fee paid may be higher but aims to encompass full-scope financial guidance rather than just investment portfolio oversight.Why Fees Matter Over the Long TermWhile a 1% annual fee may seem like a small price to pay for professional investment guidance and financial planning, it can significantly erode portfolio returns over long time horizons. Even seemingly minor differences in fees add up in a big way when compounded year after year for decades.Below is an example of how various financial advisor fee tiers can affect the ending value of a $2 million portfolio with a 7% average annual return over 10 years. This can illustrate that even small changes in financial advisor fees can make a substantial difference in returns over long time horizons. For context, without any fees taken out of the above $2 million portfolio, it would grow to $3,934,303 at that rate and time horizon.Annual Advisory Fee Rate

-$719,692Finding a Fee Rate That Works for YouPaying higher financial advisor fees does not guarantee receiving better investment performance or service. On the flip side, nor does paying lower financial advisor fees mean you'll automatically receive higher overall returns. If you manage your portfolio without professional help, youll save on fees but wont have access to the services that a financial advisor can provide.If you want professional aid from a financial advisor
, focus first on paying a reasonable fee for the scope of services you think you require. This also involves avoiding paying for services you aren't likely to use. For instance, maybe you have a strong retirement plan and dont need financial planning services into your retirement years. However, be sure to clearly understand exactly what personalized offerings are included in exchange for the fees paid and
negotiate
respectfully if you feel costs seem misaligned or outweigh the benefits.On the flip side, you could investigate lower-cost options like
robo-advisors
if your situation demands fairly simple, automated portfolio management rather than holistic financial and investment planning. As with most major financial decisions, take the time to thoroughly weigh all pros, cons and alternatives before committing to either choice, though. And remember to review your fee arrangements periodically to ensure they continue meeting your evolving needs over time.Bottom LineA 1% annual fee on a multi-million-dollar investment portfolio is roughly typical of the fees charged by many financial advisors. But thats not inherently a good or bad thing, but rather should hold weight in your decision about whether to use an advisors services. Additionally, carefully determine what specific services you realistically need and receive in exchange for fees paid.Tips for Finding a Financial AdvisorFinding a financial advisor

Citi to Cut 20,000 Roles in Frasers Bid to Boost ReturnsThere seems to be of lot of selling of Grayscale, Scaramucci said during a Bloomberg Television interview on Friday.The hedge fund manager said that his trading desk noted that holders of the shares, which were converted from a trust this week when the US Securities and Exchange Commission signed off on the ETFs, were selling to book losses and shifting to lower fee alternatives.Selling one Bitcoin product to buy another should not impact Bitcoins price, said Zach Pandl, Grayscales managing director or research. The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a topic of conversation since Grayscales court victory last summer. Following the sharp run-up in Bitcoins valuations, its natural to see some profit taking in the asset, he said.GBTC, which has existed since 2013, posted $2.3 billion in volume on Thursday, the largest first-day turnover ever for an ETF. It has been one of the most popular channels to gain exposure to Bitcoin. On Thursday, the original cryptocurrency broke through $49,000, hitting a two-year high. It fell below $43,000 on Friday.Shares of GBTC fell 5.2% to $38.58 on Friday. They surged more than 300% last year, compared with an increase of almost 160% for Bitcoin.The second thing we are seeing is the bankruptcy estate of FTX is unloading into the ETF announcement, Scaramucci said. There is a heavy volume of selling in Bitcoin right now. I do expect the supply overhang to be done in the next six to eight trading days.Story continuesFTX, which was one of the largest crypto exchanges, filed for bankruptcy in 2022 along with a flurry of major crypto companies amid a market crash. It still holds large amounts of crypto assets and is in the process of unwinding.One last thing, there has been a quiet period for the Wall Street. Wall Street has not been able to market these ETFs and that will start in about eight days as well, Scaramucci said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerbergs Top Priority

Citi to Cut 20,000 Roles in Frasers Bid to Boost ReturnsNet charge-offs at Bank of America and Wells Fargo rose during the fourth quarter partly due to office loans, according to earnings releases Friday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. set aside more reserves because of a deteriorating outlook on commercial-property valuations, the bank reported Friday.Banks have been grappling with fallout from climbing office vacancies in the aftermath of the pandemic and financing costs that have soared as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Thats caused a 35% decline in office prices from a peak in early 2022, according to real estate analytics firm Green Street.The challenges wont likely let up soon. Bank of America has about $7.6 billion of office loans maturing in 2024, and $3.1 billion in 2025, according to a presentation. While about 75% of its office loans are backed by higher-quality buildings, its percentage of non-performing office loans ticked up during the fourth quarter.At Wells Fargo, non-accrual loans for offices totaled $3.4 billion at the end of December, up from $2.8 billion at the end of September and $186 million a year ago. The vast majority of Wells Fargos property loans that were considered non-accrual at the end of 2023 were backed by offices.As expected, losses started to materialize in our commercial real estate office portfolio as market fundamentals remained weak, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Michael Santomassimo said Friday on a call with investors. While the charge-offs we took in the fourth quarter were contemplated in our allowance, we are still early in the cycle.Story continuesCommercial-property loans accounts for 16% of the Wells Fargos total loans at the end of December.

), Google (
GOOG
,
GOOGL
), and Meta (
META
). Until now.The Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the world's most valuable company in a rough start to the new year.According to
the New York Times, US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apples closely guarded ecosystem. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the companys suite of products  including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags  blocks competition.""You don't ramp up unless you find that there's something significant there that you want to investigate,"" adjunct Columbia University Law School professor
Martin Edel
said about the reported probe. The multiyear probe, he said, tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue.Still, he cautioned, it's possible that the DOJ's investigation doesn't turn up any wrongdoing on Apple's part.Threatening the 'walled garden'Apple's antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China as that country's economy continues to sputter. On Friday Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day.Apple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro spatial computer. The AR/VR headset, which goes on sale Feb. 2, is Apple's first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the company's successor to the iPhone.But the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space, and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use.Story continuesA DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apples ""walled garden"" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams. Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative. The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.Edel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly, and not how it established prominent market position.The iPhone 15 Pro is presented during the ""Wonderlust"" event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. (Loren Elliott/REUTERS/File Photo)
(REUTERS / Reuters)Apple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration, which has kept up an aggressive push to reign in Big Tech.""The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means,"" Edel said.University of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy, and monopolization cases are among the hardest, the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table.For one, he said, prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint.""If I were Apple, Id be pretty worried about this,"" Newman said, adding that the DOJ has some of the worlds top antitrust litigators in-house.The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after its unveiling on June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File)
(ASSOCIATED PRESS)Critics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways, including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales.The company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giant's payment technology.Interoperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point, as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apple's devices and services can use.The Epic effectThere are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple.One is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October. Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple.In that case, the appeals court upheld a
California trial court's ruling that said
Apple did not hold a monopoly in the market for mobile app stores.However, in a minor win for Epic, the appeals court also upheld the trial court's ruling that said under anti-steering laws Apple must allow app developers to offer more ways for app users to pay for purchases.Apple and Epic are now appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, which has yet to say whether it will hear the case. What impact the case would have on a DOJ-led antitrust suit, Newman said, would depend on where the department chose to file its case.""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games' chief executive Tim Sweeney leaves after a weekslong antitrust trial at federal court in Oakland, Calif, in 2021. (Brittany Hosea-Small/REUTERS)
(REUTERS / Reuters)""They could take the fight to Apples doorstep, but that would cause the Epic case to loom larger over a DOJ case,"" Newman said. ""DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate.""Google's battleThe second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market.Closing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March. Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures, including Apple, a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines.The lion's share of those payments went to Apple. Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. At $20 billion, the payments would represent somewhere between 5.5% and 7% of Apple's annual revenue over the last three years.If the DOJ's investigation of Apple is in fact near its end, Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple.Those talks and negotiations, he said, could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Consumer prices fell for a third-straight month in December, the longest streak since 2009, deepening concerns about companies profits and share prices.Thats all symbolic of a very weak consumption environment that includes lack of consumer confidence and weak income growth, said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director for Asian equities at abrdn. We are cautious on 4Q earnings across most sectors, and would assume that continues in 1Q unless the government starts doing something massive to support the economy.Gauges of consumer stocks have been the worst performers on the MSCI China Index since the end of September, after the real estate measure. The aggregate market value of companies included in the two consumer indexes has fallen by about $157 billion since. And the biggest drags on the MSCI benchmark in this span include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., restaurant operator Yum China Holdings Inc. and EV maker BYD Co.  which have all been offering big discounts.The worlds second-largest stock market has started 2024 on a dismal note, with the MSCI China gauge already down more than 4% so far this year. It capped a third straight annual decline in 2023.The bigger picture is that the weak demand is leading to a deflationary environment, which particularly bodes ill for businesses that cannot achieve higher volumes with lower prices, said Daisy Li, a fund manager at EFG Asset Management HK Ltd.Story continuesREAD"

For a comparison, the median household income in the United States in 2022 was $74,580. As a result, you must make over seven times the typical household income to be a high-income earner.While

All the market research said US consumers like really big cars.But when Thuy visited the US to meet with dealers in September and showed off the smaller VF3, she said they urged her to compete on the lower end of the market.Everybody said, 'definitely, its going to be the biggest volume for us,' Thuy said.

Biden Says US Doesnt Support Taiwan Independence After Vote
Nvidias Red-Hot 2024 Start a Bright Spot as S&P 500 Eyes RecordCongressional negotiators are locked in talks over renewing expired business tax breaks and boosting the child tax credit, evenly split between both. The proposal will need to pass through a Congress that is deeply divided over the nations fiscal trajectory, as some Republican lawmakers push for deep spending cuts as a condition for averting another government shutdown on Jan. 19 and Feb. 2, when temporary funding expires.If passed, the tax breaks offer a double-edged sword for an economy that appears on course for a soft landing.While the extra cash would boost consumer spending, it would also risk reigniting inflation pressures  complicating prospects for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates this year, economists warned. Data for December show that inflation picked up at the end of 2023, fueled by services costs while a decline in goods prices petered out. The consumer price index increased 3.4% in the year through December, the most in three months. Prices for clothing and cars continue to increase.Mickey Levy, a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, said the tax measures would add fuel to an economy that is already growing faster than estimates for its long run potential. The legacy of pandemic-era fiscal stimulus continues to juice growth, he said.Theres already substantial fiscal stimulus driving up economic activity, he said.Analysts say much will depend on the final details of any agreement and how the tax breaks will be structured. The draft deal would extend breaks through 2025.Story continuesThe talks were still in flux as lawmakers left for the long weekend Friday. After halting progress earlier in the week, several potential roadblocks to a bipartisan agreement emerged, including differences over the state-and-local tax deduction cap, an expansion to the low-income housing tax credit and a more robust child tax credit.If a deal does come together, money could start flowing to households as soon as March, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates for reducing deficits and debt. He cautions the proposal will do little to encourage additional corporate investment.Business BreaksThe proposed deal would revive tax breaks for research and development spending, boost the deductibility of investment, such as in equipment, and business loans. Lawmakers are discussing restricting benefits for foreign research investments in order to target the benefits to companies conducting such activities in the US.This is going to be a decent amount of fiscal cost with very little of it going to encourage new investment in a time when there are still inflation pressures, Goldwein said.Still, the plan could be a boon for President Joe Biden, whose poll numbers have slumped amid voter anxiety over the economy. Asked how the White House is weighing the potential inflationary impact of any proposal, Bidens top economic adviser instead emphasized benefits of the bill.We are very much hoping that we can see a balanced package, National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard said Thursday. But what is critical for the president is that the child tax credit be extended and particularly be made available for low and moderate income families, because it is so powerful in reducing child poverty.Child CreditThe child tax credit boost on the table as of last week wouldnt be nearly as much as the Covid-era version, which took the maximum credit from $2,000 to $3,600 per child. Its also not fully refundable for those without tax burdens, nor would it be paid monthly. Those details could change, as many Democrats vow to block the current deal.Nancy Vanden Houten, a lead economist at Oxford Economics, said the overall size of the tax package wouldnt be enough to derail her view that the Fed will cut rates in May.The impact on the broader economy would be relatively small, and probably not enough to change our forecast for inflation and the Fed, Houten said.At the very least, the tax negotiations underscore that lawmakers remain a long way from entering an era of austerity even amid warnings from ratings firms and investors that the US fiscal trajectory is unsustainable.Tax SeasonMoodys Investors Service in November warned it could downgrade the sovereign US rating because of wider budget deficits and political polarization. It lowered the outlook to negative from stable while affirming the grade at Aaa. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in August.If the tax proposal is agreed, negotiators are aiming for Congress to enact it before the Jan. 29 start of the annual tax-filing season.If it passes, it just becomes another shot in the arm for an economy that maybe does, or maybe doesnt, need it, said Owen Tedford, a senior research analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors LLC.--With assistance from Erik Wasson.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerbergs Top Priority

PayPal (PYPL)
, for instance. Over the past 12 months, the shares have shed 24% while the
S&P 500
has recorded gains of 20%.The drop has come as the company faces challenges in losing market share for its branded products, leading to a decline in both transaction percentage and transaction dollars.That has left Truist analyst Andrew Jeffrey frustrated, although the analyst remains in PayPals corner, despite conceding that many investors might need more convincing to get on board again. We are long-term bulls, based on attractive risk/reward, but acknowledge that PYPL could remain relatively range bound until branded volume and transaction $ stabilize, the 5-star analyst explained. That said, we still believe that PayPal still occupies an important position in the eCommerce ecosystem. This creates what we consider an asymmetric risk/ reward in which modest monetization and/or share gains could cause a disproportionate positive re-rating.For 2024 and 2025, Jeffrey anticipates modest yet noticeable growth in branded volume and transaction dollars. The forecast is tied to the companys initiatives aimed at transitioning from Braintree PSP (payment service provider) volume to branded solutions. That said, Jeffrey does admit that this is a tenuous forecast that relies solely on discussions with the company and anecdotal evidence that a more assertive Braintree pricing model and early efforts to enhance value-added services around its PSP offering could create a more favorable backdrop. We still need more evidence that this strategy is bearing fruit, and we recognize that Braintree price concessions could have their own adverse transaction % repercussions, the analyst went on to add.Nevertheless, Jeffrey states several reasons to back the PayPal case, including the view that eCommerce is a structural tailwind, and that even in the face of competitive challenges, PayPals two-sided network offers at least as much value to merchants as other wallets, like Apple Pay, and PSPs, like Stripe and Adyen. Moreover, the company generates plenty of FCF, and boasts a robust balance sheet. Lastly, absent material incremental fundamental deterioration, the stocks undemanding valuation suggests an attractive risk/reward.Story continuesAs such, Jeffrey maintained a Buy rating on the shares and raised the price target from $65 to $73, implying investors will pocket returns of 20% a year from now. (To watch Jeffreys track record,

A rise in geopolitical risk has triggered safe-haven buying and pushed gold prices higher. Moreover, investors' interest rate expectations turned more dovish after the US reported a 0.1% decline in monthly PPI.

sell-the-news event
, one that analysts previously warned was possible given the tokens rapid price appreciation in the past months.Sell the news is a well-known term in capital markets and describes how asset prices, leverage and sentiment run-up in the lead-up to a bullish event, only for prices to tumble shortly after.BTC pulled back to as low as $41,500 early Monday, before recovering,
after briefly hitting its two-year high
above $49,000 as the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. started trading last Thursday.The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. was much anticipated and well priced, so the event will likely be a short- to mid-term top for the price, analysts at Japan-based crypto exchange bitBank told CoinDesk in an email.Bitcoin could be vulnerable to profit-taking selling pressures in the short term, but given lower U.S. treasury yields and the markets optimistic outlook for the Feds early rate cuts, its downside risk may be limited, they added.bitBank said it considered the $40,000 psychological level as a support for bitcoin prices in the near term. Elsewhere, analysts at 10x Research, led by Markus Thielen, said in a
Monday note
that they expected prices to find support at as low as $38,000.Meanwhile, FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in a Monday email that a correction to at least $40,000 per bitcoin would be within bounds of typical corrections, given the cryptocurrencys price performance of over 150% over 2023.As such, long-term expectations for bitcoin remain largely bullish, given the apparent demand for ETFs, as volumes indicate, among institutional players.Bitcoin ETFs will be transformative for the industry, allowing for vastly greater access from traditional wealth management - their launch will bring new investment into bitcoin from pensions, endowments, insurance companies, sovereign wealth, retirement plans, trusts, and many more, shared Henry Robinson, founder at crypto fund Decimal Digital Group, in an email to CoinDesk.However, while the ETF launches are exciting, we think they offer no advantage over self-custody. For long-term holders, the fee emissions will bleed a position substantially. It may take many years, but we expect demand for ETFs to dwindle as bitcoin adoption rises and self-custody becomes more common among institutions, Robinson added."

It plans to raise that to 33% by 2026 as it rolls out six new models in its ""Neue Klasse"" EV-only line, a multibillion-euro effort to jump the technology gap with competitors.Still, BMW's margins for combustion engine and all-electric cars won't reach parity before at least 2026, Mertl said, pointing to the higher costs of introducing new battery technologies for later models.Discounting is also likely for cars in certain price ranges, Mertl said, without going into further detail.The carmaker is sticking to its previously announced target of 3 million vehicles sold by 2030 with an 8-10% margin in its automotive segment, he added - a conservative goal sitting below its expected 2023 margin of around 10.3%.BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said in September that the company would be ""at least as profitable"" when selling the ""Neue Klasse"" EVs at scale, bolstered by their lower battery costs and higher efficiency per kilowatt hour.(Reporting by Victoria Waldersee, Christina Amann; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)"

The companys 750 million ($821 million) unsecured notes due in May next year plummeted 15 cents on the euro to 53 cents, the most since November 2018 according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Atos has faced a series of setbacks and governance changes in recent years as it attempts to split up its operations ahead of more than 2 billion in debt repayments in the coming two years.The company is in discussions to sell its legacy Tech Foundations unit to Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinskys EPEI. It resumed talking to Airbus SE about a potential sale of its big data and cybersecurity business, Atos announced earlier this month.

The parties are now renegotiating the terms of the deal.On Sunday, Le Figaro reported that Atos chairman Jean-Pierre Mustier was weighing asking a commercial court to appoint a so-called mandataire ad hoc to assist him in refinancing negotiations with the groups banks. Atos said Monday that it had not filed a request to appoint a mandataire ad hoc.In early January, the IT company said it was considering other ways to raise cash including further asset sales that would far exceed an earlier target of 400 million.

In the weeks leading up to the date of approval, Wednesday, Jan. 10, bitcoin rallied to a recent high of ~$48,000.Many analysts and traders are now hoping the
upcoming bitcoin halving
 when the rate of new bitcoins issued to network validators (aka miners) is slashed  could be a similar catalyst for crypto prices. There is a longstanding debate whether these programmatically triggered events that occur once every four years are
priced in.The approval of bitcoin ETFs last week may give some indication of whats to come for the next bitcoin hype cycle. The listing of 11 new bitcoin funds was a clear moment to sell, at least in hindsight, and bitcoin has since sagged ~12% to $42,250 today.

SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.That compares to the year-earlier net profit of T$295.9 billion.Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations from TSMC data released last week, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-earlier period, but that still beat both the company's and market's expectations.Global demand for semiconductors began to weaken in the second half of 2022, but analysts say inventories at smartphone and computer makers are running down and restocking demand is expected to pick up.Given that, much of Thursday's focus will be on TSMC's outlook for this year.Fubon Securities analysts said that having previously expressed concern for TSMC's first quarter outlook, they now believed Apple wafer demand remains ""steady in the short term"".""Although there will be seasonal slowdown in 1Q24, which is widely known by the market, we have not seen additional order cuts.""KGI Securities analysts said they expected first quarter sales to outperform typical slow season seasonality and that for the full year it saw mid-20% top-line growth in U.S. dollar terms due to demand recovery and silicon content driven by 5G and high performance computing applications.Story continuesThe AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock having surged 32% in 2023, compared with a 27% gain for the broader market.TSMC is due to report at 0600 GMT on Thursday.($1 = 31.4220 Taiwan dollars)(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

Investing.com,The Ninja Price Increase - Shrinkflation,2024-01-16,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
You know all about price inflation and how it squeezes your wallet. But there are also ninja price increases out there that you might not notice. It's called ""shrinkflation.""
Inflation robs you of purchasing power by driving up the price of everything you buy. The government reports price inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) but it's a lot worse than they're telling you.
In the first place, the CPI is rigged to understate the extent of price inflation. You probably realize this every time you go to the store.
But price inflation also manifests itself in ways a government formula could never capture, and you may not even notice. Not only do you pay more for everything you buy, you get less.Literally.
And that's called shrinkflation.
Consumers aren't the only ones struggling with rising prices. Producers have to deal with them as well. The cost of materials, labor, and equipment go up, putting the squeeze on companies' bottom lines. Eventually, they have to pass those costs on to their customers.
But raising prices isn't a popular move. Ideally, a company would love to hide the price increase from you.
Enter shrinkflation.
Instead of raising the price, the company just gives you less for the same amount of money. It does this by shrinking packages or putting less stuff in the same size container.Shrinkflation doesnt show up in the CPI, and most of the time, you probably dont even notice. But the effect is the same as rising prices. You ultimately end up with less stuff.
It is stealth inflation.
Here's a recent example courtesy of Campbell's Soup.But as my friend astutely pointed out, it is ""part and parcel"" of a bigger picture and it reveals exactly what the government is doing to your money as a matter of policy.
The devaluation of the dollar manifests itself everywhere in ways we dont even expect or measure. The consumer price index measures inflation charitably by allowing, at their discretion, for the use of substitute goods and services to offset price increases. There are no aggregate metrics to account for the decrease in quality of goods, for shrinkflation, and the precipitous declines were experiencing in the quality and formerly personal nature of important services.
MousePrint.org chronicles shrinkflation. Here are some recent examples.Most of the time, consumers don't even notice shrinkflation. But when they do, they get mad. And their anger is usually directed at the greedy corporations that are charging them the same for less.
But there's another culprit.
The Federal Reserve.
Price inflation is a symptom of monetary inflation. As the central bank creates money out of thin air and injects it into the economy, prices generally rise. Economist Murray Rothbard noted that since governments have deemed paper tickets and ""computer digits"" money, then the government, as dominant money-supplier, becomes free to create money costlessly and at will. As a result, this inflation of the money supply destroys the value of the dollar or pound, drives up prices, cripples economic calculation, and hobbles and seriously damages the workings of the market economy.
Companies can't just ignore their cost problems. They can either raise prices, which will make you mad, or shrink package sizes, which will still make you mad, but you might not notice.
But the end result is always the same. You end up paying more and getting less."
Investing.com,The Transitory Inflation Myth,2024-01-16,0.666667,"The year-over-year growth rate of the US CPI was reported last Thursday to be 3.4%. This was 0.3% higher than the number reported for the preceding month and 0.2% higher than the average forecast, but the overall picture (refer to the chart below) is unchanged. The downward trend that began in June of 2022 is intact and we expect that the 2023 low will be breached during the first quarter of this year. However, the main purpose of this discussion is not to delve into the details of the latest CPI calculation but to debunk the persistent idea that the price inflation of 2020-2022 was mainly due to supply disruptions.The following chart shows the price of
natural gas
in Europe. This is an example of what happens when a supply disruption is the main cause of a large price rise. After the supply issue is resolved, the price falls back to near where it was prior to the disruption.By the way, there are many commodities that over the past few years experienced spectacular price rises due to disrupted supply followed by equally spectacular price declines. We could, for instance, make the same point using a price chart of
Oil
,
Wheat
or
Coal
.Its happening this way because the main driver of the inflation was a huge increase in the money supply combined with a huge increase in government deficit spending. In effect, all of the purchasing power loss that has occurred to date has been locked in and the best that people can expect from here is for their money to lose purchasing power at a reduced pace. In this respect the inflation is operating the same way as compound interest, except that instead of getting interest on interest people are experiencing cost-of-living increases on top of previous cost-of-living increases."
Investing.com,How the January Effect Has Evolved Over the Decades,2024-01-16,0.666667,"The January effect, named for the perceived market anomaly where stock returns in January are higher than in other months, has been a subject of interest since it was first written about in 1942.Traditionally, this effect has been attributed to tax-loss harvesting at the end of the year, where investors dump their laggards to offset capital gains taxes, leading to a December selloff. This is believed to be followed by a buying spree in January, as investors repurchase stocks, boosting demand and prices.Other explanations for the January effect include the influx of cash from year-end bonuses into the stock market, the rise of tax-sheltered retirement accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s, etc.) and the prevalence of new investment instruments and regulatory changes.Then theres also a perceived increase in investment activity as people follow through on New Years resolutions to invest more. January, after all, has long been associated with fresh starts and positive animal spirits. A recent YouGov poll found that about a third of American adults made New Years resolutions for 2024.The January effect may have been a pronounced trend in the past, but in more recent years, its delivered diminishing returns.Take a look at the visual below.

Investing.com,Central Banks Prioritize Inflation Fight Over Growth Concerns,2024-01-16,0.222222,"I sense that the first quarter of this year will be marked by the realization that its too early for the central banks to cut the interest rates unless something really bad  like another bank crisis, or a real estate crisis, or another debt crisis hits the fan.Because March  where market prices reflect the first rate cuts from both the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) - is about two months away, and things dont look *that* bad.In Europe, growth is slowing, Germany is struggling to reverse slow down, the slump in the Eurozones
industrial production
accelerated, and production fell 6.8% in November from a year earlier.Over the last 9 readings, only one came in positive, and it was a small 0.2% growth back in June. But the economic slowdown is what the ECB needs to pull inflation lower.And unless there is a sharp slowdown in economic activity, the ECB wont hurry up to cut rates. On the contrary, the bank is now focused on waning the pandemic-era aid programs.According to a recent Bloomberg survey, the ECB will make four 25bp cuts this year starting in June instead of six rate cuts starting from April  as priced in by the markets.In the US, the resilient growth, healthy jobs market, and sustained fiscal spending into the presidential election suggest no urge for a Fed cut in March.The divergence between the reason and market pricing suggests that the rate cut expectations will be gently delayed and pricing will be revisited.If thats the case, stock and bond markets should correct to the downside, and the
US dollar
should recover.The US dollar kicked off this week on a positive note, as the
EUR/USD
made a swift move to the downside following ECB Holzmanns words in Davos yesterday. Holzmann warned that the threats from looming inflation will likely prevent the ECB from lowering the rates this year, even as a recession can no longer be ruled out.He pointed at the conflict in the Middle East as a risk for further disruption to supply chains and energy markets and cautioned that the latter developments will likely keep the ECB alert regarding the price risks. The euro fell and the
Stoxx 600
retreated.One thing that prevents inflation worries from darkening the mood is the subdued reaction from oil markets. The escalation of the conflict in the Red Sea region no longer fuels oil prices. Despite news of further attacks and retaliation,
US crude
saw limited upside yesterday and closed the session slightly lower. Resistance remains intact into $75pb level.But if inflation worries resurface, weak economic data will no longer fuel the central bank doves and act as good news.The EUR/USD has the potential to fall further. The next natural target for the euro bears stands at 1.0875, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on the latest rebound that started in October. Below this level, the EUR/USD will step into the medium-term bearish consolidation zone.Cable could return below 1.25, and the
USD/JPY
could attempt to break the 100-DMA  near 147.40. But the consensus for the USD/JPY remains bearish as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) should exit the negative rate policy. Japanese policymakers could be further encouraged to act in case of strong annual wage-negotiation results."

Yahoo Finance,"US lawmakers reach $78 billion deal on tax breaks, but passage uncertain",2024-01-16,0.666667,"By Susan Heavey and David LawderWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The leaders of Congress tax-writing committees on Tuesday announced a nearly $80 billion bipartisan deal to enhance tax breaks for businesses and low-income families through 2025, but prospects for passage are unclear amid bitter fiscal divisions.The $78 billion package, agreed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, a Democrat, and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, a Republican, would temporarily expand the child tax credit and boost the low-income housing tax credit. It would restore business tax deductions for 100% of research and development expenses and capital expenditures for plant and equipment.The extensions would last until the end of 2025, aligning them with the expiration of personal tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017 and raising the stakes for tax policy differences in November's presidential election.The deal would increase the maximum ""refundable"" child tax credit -- the amount available as a cash payment -- by $200 per child to $1,800 for 2023, $1,900 for 2024 and $2,000 for 2025.Democrats have been trying to restore a much larger COVID-era expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child, which expired in 2021.Wyden said the plan would benefit 15 million children from low-income families while enabling the construction of more than 200,000 affordable housing units.SHORT TIMELINE, UNCLEAR PATHWyden said he and Smith want to pass the package quickly so that families and businesses can take advantage of the breaks as they file tax returns this year. The filing season for 2023 income is due to start on Jan. 29.""I'm going to pull out all the stops to get that done,"" Wyden said.But the early legislative calendar this year is consumed with bitter divisions over government spending, including another proposed stopgap to avert a federal shutdown until March to buy more time to pass funding measures.Story continuesSmith emphasized the extension of business tax breaks, which Republicans have sought to extend as they began to phase out after 2022.""This legislation locks in over $600 billion in proven pro-growth, pro-America tax policies with key provisions that support over 21 million jobs,"" Smith said.The lawmakers plan to offset the tax package's cost by closing the COVID-era Employee Retention Tax Credit to new claims by the end of January 2024, rather than April 15, 2025. The early end of the troubled program, along with increased enforcement and higher penalties for fraudulent claims, is expected to save more than $70 billion, according to Joint Committee on Taxation estimates.According to a summary of the legislation, the deal also includes provisions to shield Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers operating in the U.S. from dual taxation despite the lack of a U.S.-Taiwan tax treaty.It also includes tax breaks for disaster-related losses, including from certain wildfires.In a sign that changes would likely be needed, the top Senate Finance Committee Republican, Mike Crapo, called the Wyden-Smith deal ""a thoughtful starting point"" for the legislation, indicating that it needed changes. He said in a statement that he would work ""to build broad, bipartisan support for a tax package that provides appropriate relief for working families and businesses.""The White House was still reviewing the agreement, spokesperson Michael Kikukawa said, noting that President Joe Biden ""remains committed to fighting for the full expanded child tax credit.""(Reporting by Susan Heavey and David Lawder; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Rosalba O'Brien)"

.Part of the problem is that the board hasnt felt enough pressure to change, Minow explains. Boeing, as half of a duopoly, has only one major competitor, Airbus. It also holds government and commercial airline contracts that guarantee it business. Given the companys market dominance, the board has allowed Boeing to put financialnot aviationengineering first. The inevitable results were what we saw, says Minow, who owns Boeing shares.Others may criticize the company for not sufficiently overhauling its board and leadership immediately after the Max 8 fatalities.

ahead of safety. But Calhoun, a veteran GE executive, had been the board's lead director overseeing Muilenburgs term and close ally to the prior chief executive who led the firm into the
rushed development
of the 737 Max 8.Meanwhile, Boeings current chair Larry Kellner has been a director since 2011 and previously led its audit committee.But will this fix what needs fixing? Jon Ostrower, editor-in-chief of The Air Current and former
Wall Street Journal
aerospace reporter, asked
in 2019
in response to the leadership revamp. Both Calhoun and Kellner had consistently blessed [Boeings] long-term strategy, he wrote.Story continuesHe wasnt the only one with misgivings. In 2020, proxy advisor Glass Lewis urged investors
to vote against
Kellner at the companys shareholder meeting, citing his role as audit committee chair during the 737 Max 8 crashes. Vanguard, Boeings top shareholder,
voted against
Kellner that year, referencing ""control failures"" by the audit committee. The following year, Glass Lewis advised against reelecting Kellner
a second time
.A handful of other board directors were also singled out by advisors, and consumer advocate Ralph Nader, whose grandniece died in the second Boeing 737 Max 8 crash,
called for
the whole board to resign.But during board shakeups, companies are expected to hang on to key people for the sake of continuity as they introduce new talent with fresh perspectives. After reviewing recent board changes at Boeing, Jo-Ellen Pozner, associate professor of management at Santa Clara Universitys Leavey School of Business, says she applauds the company for adding aviation and risk experts while replacing directors with financial, government, and trade expertise. If I were putting together a board for Boeing, this is what I would choose, she says of the current group. (More than half of the 13 current
board members
have joined since 2019.)Still, Pozner cautions that organizational culture is sticky. It takes time for transformational changes to trickle down from the board into a companys operations, and the newest directors on Boeings board are likely only hitting their stride about now. What happens over the next few weeks will reveal whether the board is indeed prepared for adversity and attuned to the right issues.Boeing didnt immediately respond to

Yahoo Finance,"Analysis-Hertz's EV sale to fan cost concerns, dampen used-car market",2024-01-16,0.333333,"By Akash Sriram and Nathan Gomes(Reuters) - Electric vehicles were already considered expensive and hard to repair. Now their image could take another hit as rental giant Hertz dumps 20,000 of them, including Teslas, for gas-powered cars.Hertz, the largest U.S. fleet operator of EVs, has blamed the sale on high repair costs and weak demand for the vehicles it offers on rent.Analysts and industry experts believe the move will affect the second-hand market for EVs and dissuade buyers who are already rethinking big purchases due to higher borrowing costs.""The larger impact of Hertz EV fire sale is the perception hit to the technology,"" said Karl Brauer, analyst at used-car aggregator iSeeCars.com.""Mainstream consumers are already hesitant to buy an EV, and this news only supports their concerns.""The higher costs associated with repairing EVs stem from a lack of sufficient expertise in dealing with such vehicles and challenges in getting the replacement parts as they are still very new, industry experts said.Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr flagged elevated costs caused by damages to certain EVs, particularly Teslas, last year at a conference.Tesla and Polestar, whose cars are popular with car rental firms, did not respond to a request for comment. Car rental firm Avis and Enterprise also did not respond to a query on its EV strategy.CEO Scherr said Hertz limited the torque and speed on the EVs and offered them to more experienced users to ensure easier rides after certain renters had front-end collisions.Growing pains for startups and legacy automakers that are new to the technology also mean that EVs have been facing more problems than gas-powered cars, according to a survey last year by non-profit Consumer Reports.The survey, covering owner responses on more than 330,000 vehicles, showed that EVs from the past three years had 79% more problems than conventional cars.For many EVs, there is no way to repair or assess even slightly damaged battery packs after accidents, which forces insurance companies to write off the cars with a few miles - leading to higher premiums and undercutting gains from going electric.Story continuesGerman rental firm SIXT said on Tuesday it signed a multi-billion euro deal with Stellantis to buy up to a quarter of a million vehicles.The deal will also see Stellantis provide some EVs to the German mobility service provider, but the companies did not offer further details.Hertz' move underscores a wider shift in the EV landscape.After pledging billions of dollars for their EV ambitions in recent years, legacy automakers have pulled back their production plans as demand slows.EV sales growth in North America is expected to slow to about 27% this year from a scorching 72% in 2023, according to market research firm Canalys.CUT-PRICE SALEHertz may have to dispose of the EVs at hefty discounts due to the higher miles they have covered as well visible damage such as nicks, scratches and dents, according to experts.""Having rented several Model 3s from Hertz over the past six months, my observation is some of them are cosmetically pretty rough,"" said Scott Case, CEO of EV research firm Recurrent Auto.Nearly all of the more than 500 used EVs the company has on sale are Teslas, with some Model 3 compact sedans being listed for as little as $21,000 - half the price of a new car and up to $10,000 lower than cars of similar mileage at other sellers.Such a cut-price sale would likely reverberate across the second-hand market of EVs, which already command a lower price than conventional cars.The value of used EVs has dropped 33.7% between October 2022 and October 2023, even as the overall used car market dropped only 5.1%, according to data from iSeeCars.Hertz could, however, benefit from the $4,000 tax credit for some used EVs under the Inflation Reduction Act, which brings down the price of some vehicles it is trying to sell well below many gas-powered cars.Some experts also said the high repair costs of EVs are a short-term challenge that comes with any technology and will ease as more of those vehicles hit the road.""The infrastructure has to catch up with the transition, and that will bring the prices down,"" said Lynne McChristian, director of the Office of Risk Management and Insurance Research at the University of Illinois.(Reporting by Akash Sriram, Nathan Gomes in Bengaluru; Writing by Aditya Soni)"

Yahoo Finance,I Will Make $200k This Year. How Can I Use a Backdoor Roth to Avoid Taxes in Retirement?,2024-01-17,0.666667,"If youre a relatively high earner, you might be locked out of making
Roth IRA contributions
due to the accounts associated income caps. In that case, you can instead consider a conversion, otherwise known as a ""backdoor Roth.""The advantage to doing this is that you will avoid all income taxes on withdrawals from the assets that you convert. The disadvantage is that this comes with a significant up-front tax bill, which is money you could have otherwise invested. However, if your goal is to
avoid taxes in retirement
, a Roth conversion can be an effective option.Do you have questions about managing taxes in retirement?
Speak with a financial advisor today
.What Is a Backdoor Roth IRA?A Roth IRA has two restrictions that don't apply to most other tax-advantaged retirement accounts.The first is a low contribution cap. As of 2024, individuals under 50 cannot contribute more than $7,000 per year to a Roth IRA, while that limit is $8,000 per year for those over 50. This is roughly one-third the
401(k) limit
, for instance.Roth IRAs also have income limits to contend with, though. More specifically, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA if your income exceeds $161,000 for single filers or $240,000 for joint filers. The IRS also steadily reduces your Roth IRA contribution limits at incomes between $146,000 and $161,000 for single taxpayers and $230,000 and $240,000 for joint filers.For high earners who want to take advantage of a Roth IRA's after-tax perks, these income caps are a problem. A potential solution is a Roth IRA conversion, otherwise known as a ""
backdoor Roth
.""With a conversion, you take assets in an existing pre-tax account, like a traditional IRA or 401(k), and transfer it to a Roth IRA in one lump sum. Since this is not considered a contribution, neither the income limits nor the contribution limits apply. You can convert as many assets as you would like, up to your entire pre-tax portfolio, and there is no limit on how many times you can convert funds.Story continuesIn the case of this situation, if you are an individual filer, then a $200,000 income puts you above the income caps for Roth contributions. That means a conversion is the only way you can put assets into a Roth IRA. But if you file jointly, you are below the income cap and can choose any combination of contributions and conversions.Advantages of a Roth ConversionThe benefits to a Roth conversion are already in the question posed for this article. This is one way to avoid/limit paying federal income taxes in retirement. With a
Roth IRA
, you pay taxes on your contributions, but not your withdrawals or investment growth. Since you will ideally withdraw far more from your portfolio than you will contribute, this should be a significant tax benefit down the road.Now, it's important to note that a Roth IRA does not protect you from state or local taxes as applicable. That said, those are generally quite small compared to federal income taxes. Even better, since Roth withdrawals do not count as taxable income, they do not apply to the calculation for Social Security benefits taxes.The result is that converting your retirement account to a Roth IRA will save you most, if not all, of your taxes in retirement. This is as opposed to a pre-tax account, like an IRA or a 401(k), where you do pay income tax on your withdrawals and that money does apply to your
Social Security
taxable income.Of course, this means you then cant take advantage of the income deduction benefits that pre-tax accounts offer as you contribute to them.Disadvantages of a Roth ConversionA Roth conversion comes with a large up-front tax bill.When you make a Roth conversion, the value of any assets that you convert are added to your tax bill for that year. So, for example, say you have $2 million in a 401(k) and convert the entire amount. This will save you taxes on your withdrawals, but you will owe
income taxes
on that $2 million in the tax year you complete the transfer.This can be a problem since it triggers taxes without the associated cash flow to pay the bill. This is why many people make large Roth conversions in stages, so that they only trigger that tax bill a little at a time. Note you also only pay taxes on that initial conversion. A significant advantage to a Roth conversion is that you will not pay taxes on any future growth in the account.This is the tradeoff with a Roth IRA. When you invest in a Roth account you pay taxes on the money you put in. This is money you could have invested, setting up the tradeoff of potential growth for guaranteed tax savings.Youll likely want to resolve this tension based on tax rates. If you expect that your tax rate in retirement will be higher than your current rate, or if you don't think you would invest the savings of a pre-tax account, then a Roth IRA could be worthwhile. If you expect to pay a lower tax rate in retirement compared with right now, then a
pre-tax account
could save you more money in the long run.Finally, any Roth IRA is subject to the IRS' pro-rata rule. This rule applies when you have both a pre-tax IRA and a post-tax Roth IRA. In that case you must take all withdrawals proportionally from both accounts. For example, say that you have $1 million in an IRA and $500,000 in a Roth IRA (a 2/1 ratio). If you withdraw $60,000 in a given year, you would have to take $40,000 from your traditional IRA and $20,000 from your Roth IRA (a 2/1 ratio). This can limit your flexibility when it comes to using this account.How to Set Up a Backdoor RothSetting up a Roth conversion depends on exactly how you would like to structure your tax payments, and on when you will need the money. When you make a Roth conversion you must leave the money in the account for at least five years, so plan for short-term cash flow in the meantime.To set this up, you will need a pre-tax account like an
IRA or a 401(k)
.You can then move your money a few different ways.The simplest option is a one-time, lump-sum transfer. In this case you move your entire portfolio into a Roth IRA. This can let you maximize your tax-free returns, but it can come with a steep up-front tax bill.Another option is to set up staged transfers. In this case you would convert your portfolio a portion at a time over multiple tax years. This lets you manage the tax bill triggered by each year's conversion(s), but it mitigates your tax-free returns.Finally, you can make ongoing or automatic conversions. You can do this with an IRA or with 401(k) plans that permit the option. In this case, you contribute money to a pre-tax account and leave it in place for any required holding period. Then transfer the account's assets to a Roth IRA, or you can set up an automatic transfer if your account allows this.Bottom LineAs an individual making $200,000 per year, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA if youre single, but can if youre married and file jointly. However you can convert funds from a pre-tax account into a Roth IRA through a process known as a ""backdoor Roth."" This will let you minimize federal income taxes in retirement at the cost of a large tax bill in the immediate.Roth IRA TipsA

Yahoo Finance,Spirit Airlines finds itself with few options after judge blocks deal with JetBlue,2024-01-17,0.666667,"By Rajesh Kumar SinghCHICAGO (Reuters) - Spirit Airlines faces tough choices about its future including looking for another buyer and finding other ways to shore up its finances after a federal judge on Tuesday blocked its $3.8 billion merger deal with JetBlue Airways, industry experts said.The ultra low-cost carrier has been struggling to return to sustainable profitability amid rising operating costs and persistent supply-chain problems. That has raised concerns about the company's ability to repay its debt that is due to mature next year.The airline this month completed a series of sale and leaseback transactions covering dozens of planes in a bid to repay about $465 million of debt on those jets.But with a recovery in earnings not in sight, some analysts said the company might consider a bankruptcy filing to clean up its balance sheet and reorganize into a financially stronger airline.Helane Becker, airline analyst at TD Cowen, said Spirit is likely to look for another buyer, but that a more likely scenario is a Chapter 11 filing, followed by a liquidation. She said the recent capital raise has given the company funds to self-finance a potential Chapter 11 filing.""We recognize this sounds alarmist and harsh,"" Becker said. ""But the reality is we believe there are limited scenarios that enable Spirit to restructure.""The airline is expected to burn cash over the next several years and will have to continue to raise capital to survive, said Conor Cunningham, an analyst at Melius Research.""The path forward for Spirit turns to survivability,"" Cunningham said.Asked to comment, a Spirit spokesperson referred to the company's recent capital raise but did not elaborate. The company had no other immediate comment.The airline has been among the carriers hardest hit by a snag with RTX's Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines. It is the largest operator of GTF-powered aircraft in the United States.Story continuesAs a result, it had to ground a number of planes last year. The number of grounded planes is estimated to climb steadily in 2024, from 13 in January to 41 in December.Meanwhile, excess industry capacity in its key markets is hurting its pricing power, forcing the company to indulge in promotional activity with steep discounting to fill up its planes.After its third-quarter earnings last October, Florida-based Spirit said it was evaluating its growth profile as it faced softer demand.Analysts at Seaport Research Partners downgraded the company's shares after the court's ruling, citing ""the lack of a credible path to profitability.""Spirit's woes had led to a sell-off in its stock, raising worries about the impact on JetBlue's balance sheet after the merger. With Spirit's shares losing nearly half of their value since JetBlue won its takeover battle, some analysts wondered if that would prompt JetBlue to renegotiate the terms of the deal.Spirit's shares plunged 47% on Tuesday after the court's ruling, while JetBlue's shares gained about 5%.Another option would be to find a way to placate the Justice Department's competition concerns created by the JetBlue deal. The judge who presided over the case had at one point questioned whether further asset divestitures would allow the deal to pass muster. But a lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department said the only remedy was ""a full-stop injunction that would restore competition.""Analysts also raised the possibility that rival Frontier Airlines, which had lost out in a fierce bidding war, could again make a bid.Bill Franke, whose airline-focused private equity firm Indigo Partners owns 82% of Frontier, had not ruled out making a fresh bid for Spirit if the transaction with JetBlue failed to close. Frontier declined to comment.""Spirit has to figure out its Plan C,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group. ""Plan A was to merge with Frontier, Plan B became a merger with JetBlue.""(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; Editing by Chris Sanders and Matthew Lewis)"

Policymakers also penciled in additional rate cuts in 2025 and 2026.""We are seeing strong growth that appears to be moderating, we're seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures, and we're seeing inflation making real progress,""

""After all, Chair Powell said at the Dec. 13 press conference that the committee would want to cut 'well before' inflation falls to 2%. However, we expect 'only' five cuts this year, below the six-to-seven cuts now discounted in market pricing, and we view the chance of 50 basis points steps as low.""However, some economists believe the Fed will be slower to cut rates amid signs that the fight to bring inflation back to 2%  the central bank's target rate  will be longer and bumpier than expected. The Labor Department reported last week that the
consumer price index re-accelerated
in December due to an uptick in the cost of food, energy and rent.Bank of America and UBS are predicting four rate cuts this year, beginning in May, while Wells Fargo economists are penciling in just three reductions.401(K) HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS ARE SURGING AS HIGH INFLATION SQUEEZES AMERICANSIf inflation continues to fall slower than expected, the Fed may move less aggressively to cut rates.""As long as inflation doesnt rebound and stay elevated, I believe the FOMC will be able to lower the target range for the federal funds rate this year,"" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said during a speech on Tuesday. ""When the time is right to begin lowering rates, I believe it can and should be lowered methodically and carefully.""Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference in Washington, D.C., on March 22.Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which then slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending. Higher rates helped push the average rate on 30-year mortgages above 8% earlier this year for the first time in decades. Borrowing costs for everything from home equity lines of credit, auto loans and credit cards have also spiked.In the span of just 16 months, interest rates surged from near zero to above 5%, the fastest pace of tightening since the 1980s.While
inflation has cooled
considerably in recent months, it remains up 3% compared with the same time a year ago, according to the most recent Labor Department data. Even with the recent declines, Americans continue to pay more for a number of necessities including food, medical care and rent.Yet the rapid rise in rates has not stopped consumers from spending or businesses from hiring.The labor market is continuing to chug along at a healthy pace, with
employers adding 199,000
new workers in November. Job openings remain high, and the unemployment rate recently fell to 3.7% from 3.9%.Original article source"

S&P 500
dropping by 40 bps, as the VIX surged, rates rose, and the
dollar
strengthened.A good portion of the move came today after Fed governor Chris Waller pushed back against market-based expectations on rate hikes, which added to an already strong dollar and higher rates.The
10-year
rate increased by more than 11 bps, while the
2-year
rate increased by almost eight bps, which meant the 10/2 curve rose to -16 bps and is now back to its October levels.A further steepening of the yield curve is likely to happen. The next stop could see the yield curve move back into positive territory, which could come sooner, especially if the economic data continues to support an outlook with stagflation-like tilt.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 today was supported by the 4,750 level, which contained a lot of gamma, at least for today. The index briefly dipped below the 4,750 level but found immediate support and was able to rally the rest of the day.Today will be the
CBOE Volatility Index
opex, and the hedging flows that have helped to suppress the VIX below 14 will be gone.The 14 level has been the upper bound since the beginning of the year, and that is because of the delta and gamma makeup of the options market. There is a lot of put delta at 14, likely serving as resistance.Today, the options flow that has kept the VIX below 14 will be greatly diminished, which could allow the VIX to start drifting higher, especially if the dollar continues to show strength and the yield curve steepens further.It is not a perfect fit, but the VIX index has been trading with a 10/2 curve.So, in general, what this seems to suggest is that a steeper yield curve over the short term is likely to result in higher implied volatility levels, and this fits in nicely, with the S&P 500 stalling out at the 4,800 due to options positioning and potential window of weakness, that may have started.Also, there is potential for large delta positions in mega-cap names like Meta (NASDAQ"
Investing.com,Plunge in NY Fed Manufacturing Index Shows Recession Monster Is Alive and Well,2024-01-17,0.333333,"The sharp drop in the New York Federal Reserves Empire State business-conditions index in January triggered a wave of warnings.Soon after this monthly survey data was released yesterday (Jan. 16), social media and beyond lit up, warning that this was a smoking gun for the US economys imminent descent into recession, assuming output hadnt already turned negative.But like most single-indicator releases, the crowd rushed to judgment and allowed the headlines du jour to overwhelm more thoughtful analysis.The
NY Fed Manufacturing Index
, as its popularly known, is prized as an early read each month on the manufacturing sector.The sight of this index dropping deep into negative terrain for January  the lowest reading since 2020, when the pandemic was raging  convinced some observers to warn that the jig is up and a US recession has arrived or is near.Maybe, but its hard to make a high-confidence call based on one indicator, much less one regional manufacturing indicator that draws on survey data from manufacturing executives in the NY Feds district.On that note, keep in mind that these same executives have become increasingly upbeat about the future (red line in the chart below).In fact, the NY Fed Manufacturing data is reaffirming old news. The manufacturing sector of the US overall has been in a slump for more than a year.The
ISM Manufacturing
Index in December marked the 14
th
straight month of contraction. A competing index reflects a similar condition.The question is whether manufacturing carries the same weight for analyzing the US business cycle relative to years earlier.Minds will differ, but theres no doubt that pre-pandemic assumptions about the recession signals have had a rough ride in the past few years as the economy has transitioned after an unusual and unprecedented run of macro activity and government intervention.Indeed, 2023 has been a
master class in reminding analysts
that the business cycle has evolved in surprising ways. Notably, the dark forecasts of a year ago turned out to be dead wrong.Theres no way to know for sure if an NBER-defined contraction is finally here, but there are productive and relatively reliable metrics to monitor that go well beyond cherry-picking a few indicators.Consider, for instance, another index designed by the New York Fed (and now updated by the Dallas Fed)"

Investing.com,Will Inflation Repeat the 1970s Rollercoaster?,2024-01-17,0.666667,"Appreciating Apollos graph below, comparing recent
inflation
to multiple bouts of inflation of the late 1960s, 70s, and early 80s is of utmost importance for investors.Sustained levels of high inflation are poor for stock and bond returns. Even more worrying, high inflation is insidious for the financial well-being and morale of the nations citizens. As divided as the country is today, sustained high inflation could worsen it.To properly assess whether a repeat of 70s-era inflation is possible, we must first understand why inflation was rampant during that period.With that knowledge, we can compare today with the prior episode to appreciate whether Apollos chart is a road map for the future or a spurious correlation.Due to the extreme importance of inflation on stock and bond market returns, we break this article into multiple pieces. Part One and Two discuss the causes and remedies of the inflation roller coaster spanning 1967 to 1982.Before exploring the inflationary environment of fifty years ago, it is worth pointing out that Apollos graph is misleading.First, the two vertical y-axis scales on Apollos graph are different. This makes it appear that the inflation rates of the 1970s and today are nearly identical.Second, the horizontal axis doesnt compare apples to apples. From 1960 to 1965 (not graphed), inflation fluctuated below 2% a year. In 1966, inflation started to increase consistently.In the modern time frame, the year 2020 is when the wheels for inflation were set into motion.Therefore, the recent data for comparison should start in 2020, not six years prior, when there was little inflationary impulse. The graph below adjusts both axes and provides a better comparison.While the graph above may dispel worrying similarities, what matters more is the comparison between the two economic environments.The Fed and government are primarily to blame for the 70s-era inflation. The Fed acknowledges its faults. To wit, the following paragraph from Michael Bryan, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.The painful inflation starting in the late 1960s was partly due to a prevailing post-Great Depression mindset. Notably, high levels of unemployment were unacceptable.To this end, the Employment Act of 1946 tried to coordinate monetary and fiscal policy 
to promote maximum employment
 along with a strong economy.As we will discuss later, The Federal Reserve Act of 1977 amended the Feds objectives to add stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates with maximum employment.However, before 1977, the Feds primary objective was low unemployment.
At the time, higher inflation levels, while not desired by the Fed, were an acceptable byproduct of meeting their employment objectives.To help set policy, the Fed put a lot of faith in the Phillips Curve. The theory claims that inflation and unemployment have a reliable and inverse relationship.The graph below shows the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment between 1960 and 1970. The Phillips curve proved very reliable during that period, further bolstering the Feds trust in the model.Like many economic models, the Phillips Curve does not account for human behavior and rational decision-making
.In this case, the Fed failed to consider that rational human behavior would cause the Phillips Curve to shift outward. The Fed didnt expect businesses and consumers expecting inflation to change their behaviors in ways that promote more inflation.For example, auto demand may increase because consumers rush to purchase new cars today instead of tomorrow in anticipation of higher prices. Similarly, auto manufacturers may increase prices today, anticipating metal prices will rise tomorrow.The following graph shows the once dependable Phillips Curve of the 1960s failed policymakers in the 1970s. Higher levels of inflation accompanied higher unemployment. With each peak higher in inflation, unemployment also reached new highs.Not only was the Fed relying on a faulty economic theory, but its ability to administer monetary policy was greatly amplified on August 15, 1971.The following comes from our article entitled The Fifteenth of August"
Investing.com,Gold Falls on Hawkish Fed Comments; EUR/USD Drops to 1-Month Lows,2024-01-17,0.555556,"The gold (XAU) price plunged by 1.31% on Tuesday as the
US dollar
and US Treasury yields rose, following hawkish comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller about the US interest rate path.Waller said that the US is close to achieving the Fed's inflation target of 2% but emphasized caution against early rate cuts until inflation is persistently low. The Fed is expected to maintain its policy rate at the 30  31 January meeting. However, the market forecasts a 61% chance of a rate decrease in March, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. 'Strong gains in the US dollar index are pressuring the gold market as well as a rise in US Treasury yields today on this first day back from the three-day holiday weekend,' mentioned Jim Wyckoff, the senior analyst at Kitco Metals. He also pointed out that 'one could argue that losses in gold are not bad compared to how strong the dollar is as tensions in the Middle East are keeping a floor under the prices.' The US Dollar Index rose nearly 1% to its highest point in over a month, diminishing gold's appeal to holders of other currencies.During the Asian trading session,

Investing.com,UK Inflation Unexpectedly Rises,2024-01-17,0.333333,"Yesterday was just another day where another policymaker pushed back on the exaggerated rate cut expectations. Federal Reserves (Fed) Christopher Waller said that the Fed should go methodically and carefully to hit the 2% inflation target, which according to him is within striking distance, but with economic activity and labor markets in good shape, he sees no reason to move as quicky or cut as rapidly as in the past, and as is suggested by the market pricing. So that was it. Another enlightening moment went down the markets throat in the form of a selloff in both equities and bonds. The
US 2-year
yield  which captures the rate expectations rebounded 12bp, the
10-year
yield jumped past the 4%, the
US Dollar Index
recovered to a month high and is testing the 200-DMA resistance to the upside this morning, while the
S&P 500
retreated 0.37%.Waller spoke from the US yesterday, but many counterparts are wining, dining, and speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, which doesnt only offer snowy and beautiful scenery this January, but also serves as a platform to many policymakers to bring the market back to reason. Expect more comments of this hawkish kind during this week. It turns out that one of the most popular topics of this years WEF is rising inflationary risks due to the heating tensions in the Red Sea which disrupt the global trade roads and explode the shipping costs.The European Central Bank (ECB) officials were the first ones to push back the rate cut expectations. They were the first ones to attract attention to the looming inflation risks and to the idea that the ECB doesnt consider cutting the rates despite the slowing economic activity and looming recession that would  in theory  justify rate cuts in the euro area way more than rate cuts in the States, where growth and jobs numbers remain surprisingly and non-alarmingly resilient.So many ask why the EUR/USD doesnt benefit from that hawkishness. Well, it did to some extent. The pair advanced past the 1.10 level at the end of last year. Yet, the reality is, even though the ECB starts cutting the rates after the Fed and cuts less than the Fed, the deterioration in the Eurozones economic fundamentals had already started counterweighing the hawkish ECB views. And now that the Fed members have started giving out a more hawkish voice to balance out the overly stretched Fed cut expectations, the downside correction in the EUR/USD is all but surprising. From a technical perspective, there is an important development in the EUR/USD. The pair slipped below 1.0875, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on the October to now rebound and is now in the medium-term bearish consolidation zone. There is potential for a deeper fall. The next natural targets for the bears are the 200-DMA, near 1.0845, and the 50% retracement, near 1.0793.Cable rebounded following an unexpected rebound in British inflation numbers this morning. Headline inflation unexpectedly rebounded to 4%, while core inflation remained steady at 5.1% versus the expectation of a decline below the 5% mark.This mornings inflation disappointment lead sterling bears to trim bets below the 1.26 mark.To give Rishi Sunak his due, inflation in Britain more than halved last year and is expected to return to the Bank of Englands (BoE) 2% target by spring, but the possibility of a U-turn in the inflation trend due to the geopolitical developments is a mounting risk and call for a balanced approach from the BoE. But regardless of a hawkish position, the UKs anemic growth should limit any positive move in

Investing.com,Is the Subprime Auto Market Looking Fragile? I Believe So,2024-01-17,0.222222,"Last spring, I wrote about the fragility in the auto lending market.And since then, it appears that the auto market is showing increased signs of stress. Especially so for the subprime area.Thus, I believe its a good time to remember the
boiling frog
parable.In short, if a frog jumps into a pot of boiling water, itll immediately hop out. But if the frog jumps into a pot of semi-warm water, itll sit comfortably. But as the heat gradually increases to boiling levels, itll slowly cook until its too late to get out.This parable reminds us why humans react quickly to sudden events (jumping into boiling water). But fail to react to slowly changing conditions until it is too late (sitting in water as it gets warmer and warmer).So, what does this have to do with the auto market?Well, it may be something thats deteriorating slowly. And no one will notice until its too late (like the poor frog).To give you some context"
Investing.com,Gold,2024-01-17,0.555556,"I find it quite amusing that the market believes inflation is tied to rates  the propagandists at the Fed did their job there. Distract while creating bank reserves (print money) out of plain sight. The Monetary Base is up over 7% since March. M2 is also a bit higher. This is why the rate of inflation has been slowly rising again since June. Its also why
gold
is up 7% and
silver
is up 2% since the end of June (silver is up 15.9% since early March).The primary driver of my bull thesis is the shift in the Feds monetary policy. It was only a matter of time before this occurred. The Fed informally pivoted away from hiking rates at its November FOMC meeting. The markets immediately began to price several rate cuts in 2024 into stock valuations and bond yields.Follow the money  While most observers are watching what the Fed does with interest rates, few have noticed that the Fed stopped shrinking the money supply in response to the regional bank crisis in March 2023. In fact, the M2 measure of the money supply has actually increased slightly since April 2023 (while everyone merely glares at the YoY %-change in M2 that circulates social media). In addition, the Monetary Base, consisting of bank reserves and coin/currency in circulation, has increased over 7% since March 2023. This is the primary reason why the price of gold ran from $1,825 in March to $2,070 by year-end 2023.Money printing  much more so than changes in interest rates  is the fuel that drives precious metals prices higher.
While the economy is likely headed into a nasty recession this year (many sectors of the economy, like manufacturing, were already contracting during 2023), the primary factors that dictate Fed policy are the health of the banking system and the monetization of new Treasury bond issuance. Both factors will need to be addressed, in my opinion, with more money printing.Although the Feds dual mandate is to use its monetary policy to promote stable prices and full employment, its first priority is to prevent the too big to fail banks from collapsing. We saw this in 2008, again in 2020 and again in March 2023. In 2023, in response to the collapse of some big regional banks due outflow of checking and savings account funds from banks into money market funds, the Fed swiftly printed $400 billion and injected it into the banking system. In addition, it made available a QE-like facility called the Bank Term Funding Program which made funds  money created by the Fed  available to all banks.The $400 billion was removed by late June. But growth in the Monetary Base between March and the end of November (the most recent money supply report) shows that the Fed actually increased bank reserves by $410 billion. Very little of this is explained by the change in the level of currency/coin in circulation. This means that it used various back door liquidity facilities to replace the $400 billion it printed and then removed plus it added an additional $410 billion, of which only $147 billion is explained by the Bank Term Funding Program. In other words, the Fed is opaquely creating bank reserves (aka printing money) to address a burgeoning liquidity problem in the banking system.But the Fed will also have to help fund new Treasury bond issuance at some point this year. Over the next twelve months, an unprecedented $8.2 trillion in Treasury bonds will have to be refinanced. In addition, based on the first quarter of the Governments fiscal year (starting October 1, 2023), the Governments spending deficit on an annualized basis would be over $2 trillion. This is additional new debt issuance that will have to be funded  a task made more difficult by the fact that our Governments biggest foreign financiers (China, Japan, and OPEC) have been reducing their participation in Treasury auctions.Unless the Fed can find investors large enough to replace the missing foreign investment capital, it will either have to be the buyer of last resort or risk watching Treasury yields soar to a level that might induce foreign capital back to the table at Treasury bond auctions. Because considerably higher interest rates would throw the U.S. into an economic depression, the second motive for renewed money printing in 2024 will thus be a requirement for the Fed to bridge the gap between the supply and demand for Treasuries.I strongly believe that the financial and economic fundamentals are set up quite similarly, only much worse, to the conditions in 2008 that led to the Great Financial Crisis. As such, I also believe that the Feds response to the next full-blown financial system crisis will be much larger than its responses in 2008 and 2020. This should result in a cyclical bull move that I believe will be bigger than the move from late 2008 to mid-2011."

Yahoo Finance,Mother whose child died in TikTok challenge urges US court to revive lawsuit,2024-01-17,0.222222,"By Nate Raymond(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday wrestled with whether the video-based social media platform TikTok could be sued for causing a 10-year-old girl's death by promoting a deadly ""blackout challenge"" that encouraged people to choke themselves.Members of a three-judge panel of the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals noted during oral arguments that a key federal law typically shields internet companies like TikTok from lawsuits for content posted by users.But some judges questioned whether Congress in adopting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996 could have imagined the growth of platforms like TikTok that do not just host content but recommend it to users using complex algorithms.""I think we can all probably agree that this technology didn't exist in the mid-1990s, or didn't exist as widely deployed as it is now,"" U.S. Circuit Judge Paul Matey said.Tawainna Anderson sued TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance after her daughter Nylah in 2021 attempted the blackout challenge using a purse strap hung in her mother's closet. She lost consciousness, suffered severe injuries, and died five days later.Anderson's lawyer, Jeffrey Goodman, told the court that while Section 230 provides TikTok some legal protection, it does not bar claims that its product was defective and that its algorithm pushed videos about the blackout challenge to the child.""This was TikTok consistently sending dangerous challenges to an impressionable 10-year-old, sending multiple versions of this blackout challenge, which led her to believe this was cool and this would be fun,"" Goodman said.But TikTok's lawyer, Andrew Pincus, argued the panel should uphold a lower court judge's October 2022 ruling that Section 230 barred Anderson's case.Pincus warned that to rule against his client would render Section 230's protections ""meaningless"" and open the door to lawsuits against search engines and other platforms that use algorithms to curate content for their users.Story continues""Every claimant could then say, this was a product defect, the way the algorithm was designed,"" he said.U.S. Circuit Judge Patty Schwartz, though, questioned whether that law could fully protect TikTok from ""having to make a decision as to whether it was going to let someone who turned on the app know there's dangerous content here.""The arguments come as TikTok and other social media companies, including Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, are facing pressure from regulators around the globe to protect children from harmful content on their platforms.U.S. state attorneys general are investigating TikTok over whether the platform causes physical or mental health harm to young people.TikTok and other social media companies are also facing hundreds of lawsuits accusing them of enticing and addicting millions of children to their platforms, damaging their mental health.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Jonathan Oatis)"

Is bankruptcy a possibility?",2024-01-17,0.333333,"Spirit Airlines hasnt made money since before the pandemic, ticket sales havent bounced back as quickly as the carrier expected, and dozens of its planes will be grounded at times this year because of a
problem with the engines
.A sale to JetBlue represented a lifeline for Spirit, which faces $1.1 billion in debt maturing next year.But a federal judge in Boston scuttled that plan by ruling Tuesday that JetBlues $3.8 billion proposal to buy Spirit
violates antitrust law
.Now, some Wall Streeters who follow Spirit are tossing around the B word  bankruptcy. The judge had even hinted at such an outcome during the trial.After Judge William Young's ruling on Tuesday, Spirit can look for another buyer, or it could remain independent and try to push through a difficult environment for budget airlines.But a more likely scenario is a Chapter 11 filing, followed by a liquidation, wrote Helane Becker, a veteran airline analyst for financial-services firm Cowen. We recognize this sounds alarmist and harsh, but the reality is we believe there are limited scenarios that enable Spirit to restructure.JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker wasnt willing to go quite that far, but he too drew a grim picture for Spirit, which has the ticker symbol SAVE.We are not (yet) predicting an immediate SAVE chapter 11 filing, just an acknowledgement that we cannot reasonably identify a viable return to profitability any time soon, Baker and colleagues wrote in a note to clients.Baker noted that Spirit recently raised $419 million by mortgaging many of its planes. But, he added, ""from here its liquidity-raising cupboard does not appear robust.Fitch Ratings said Spirit's credit profile is now ""under pressure after the court defeat. We believe that Spirit needs to clearly articulate a near-term plan to preserve and generate liquidity, address its refinancing risk, and improve profitability to avoid a rating downgrade, the credit-rating agency said.Story continuesSpirit did not respond directly to those comments. A spokesperson for the airline pointed to a regulatory filing two weeks ago, in which the airline disclosed that it had raised $419 million through sale-and-leaseback agreements covering 25 planes.In a joint statement Tuesday, Spirit and JetBlue said they disagreed with the ruling that blocks their merger and were considering their next legal step.Judge Young stopped short of granting the government's wish for a permanent injunction against any merger between JetBlue and Spirit. During the trial, Young was troubled that such a sweeping order would be too restrictive in the ever-changing airline business.We are not going to get anywhere if you win, the merger isnt approved, and Spirit goes belly-up, the judge said to a Justice Department lawyer during closing arguments in December.Spirit, based in Miramar, Florida, last turned a full-year profit in 2019. It has lost more than $1.6 billion since then.On Wednesday, Bank of America analysts downgraded Spirit stock to underperform, suggesting there is a risk the airline might not be able to make debt payments due in September 2025.Spirit is also hindered by necessary inspections and possible replacement of Pratt & Whitney engines on many of its Airbus jets because of a manufacturing defect. The airline has predicted that it will
average 26 grounded planes
 more than 10% of its fleet  during 2024, causing a dramatic decrease in the companys near-term growth projections.Frontier Airlines tried to buy Spirit before JetBlue started  and won  a bidding war last year. But Frontier has its own challenges and is in no position to renew merger discussions with Spirit now, Baker said.Spirit shares fell 22% Wednesday after plunging 47% on Tuesday. JetBlue shares lost a more modest 9% on Wednesday, which might reflect investors breathing a sigh of relief that the purchase of Spirit appears dead, at least for now.Baker said JetBlue dodges a bullet because of the federal judges ruling. Under CEO Robin Hayes  who is stepping down next month  JetBlue wanted the planes and pilots that it would have gained through buying Spirit, but the price was simply just too much to pay, in Bakers view.Like Spirit, JetBlue has not had a profitable year since 2019, before the pandemic. But relative to its size, JetBlue's losses are more manageable than Spirits, and it has a stronger balance sheet, according to analysts.Investors are also trying to gauge what the ruling against the JetBlue-Spirit deal means for Alaska Airlines' pending proposal to buy Hawaiian Airlines. The
Biden administration
hasn't said whether it will sue to block that deal too.Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg said the government's success in blocking both the JetBlue-Spirit deal and a previous
partnership between JetBlue and American Airlines
are likely to cast a shadow over future airline (merger and acquisition) activity, with the AlaskaHawaiian deal potentially in the sights of regulators."

Investing.com,Fed's March Rate Cut Unlikely,2024-01-18,0.666667,"Investors continue to come back to their senses and the latter involves trimming the interest rate cut expectations that went ahead of themselves over the past few months. Yesterday, the Federal Reserves (Fed) Beige Book survey suggested that resilient consumer spending during the holiday season helped propel the US economy, and another solid rise in the US retail sales confirmed that spending in the US didnt slow by the end of last year. On the contrary, the latest data printed its highest pace in three months. As such, robust economic data added to the thinking that, yes, maybe March is too early for the Fed to announce the first rate cut; there is no apparent reason for the Fed to rush to the rate cuts as early as in March. The Fed will likely start cutting in the H1 but March seems overly optimistic given the ongoing strength of the economic data. The probability of a March cut fell to around 60% from around 80% at the start of the year, the

against most majors.Central bankers, bank CEOs and other influential figures continue to talk in Davos. They continue to push back on the interest rate cut expectations, they highlight the need to consider the upside risks for inflation due to the rising geopolitical tensions and they continue to warn that the markets optimism regarding the rate cuts may have the opposite impact on rate policies"

Yahoo Finance,Electric cars suffer unsustainable depreciation in secondhand market,2024-01-18,0.333333,"used electric carsElectric cars
lose as much as half of their value after just three years on the road, new figures show, as the rate of depreciation far outstrips conventional equivalents.Research from Auto Trader said there were unsustainable levels of depreciation in the electric car market, with used prices of battery-powered vehicles dropping by 23pc in the last year alone.The online vehicle marketplace said a motorist buying a 50,000 electric car could expect to lose 24,000 in value over three years, while a similarly priced petrol car could lose 17,000.The value of used electric cars has
dropped dramatically in the last 12 months
after Covid-related supply shortages eased and as rising electricity prices hit demand.This coincided with petrol prices falling to a two-year low.Auto Traders latest report warned that residual values of electric cars remain unsustainably low.It said that the price of used electric cars could come under further pressure this year as thousands of motorists return vehicles acquired on three-year leases and as manufacturers cut the price of new vehicles.With over 800,000 new electric cars registered between 2020 and 2023, supply returning to the used car market will only increase in 2024, and if demand does not keep up, electric cars could depreciate even further, undermining both consumer and retailer confidence, it said.Manufacturers are now
applying record discounts
to new electric vehicles in a bid to boost stuttering demand.Auto Trader said car makers were slashing thousands of pounds off prices, with average discounts of 10.6pc offered in December. This compares to discounts of 4.8pc a year earlier.It predicted that a
wave of Chinese entrants
would further push down the cost of electric cars.Sales of new battery-powered vehicles in Britain rose by 18pc last year but accounted for just 16.5pc of all new cars sold - a slight decline from 2022.New electric cars are still more than a third more expensive than their petrol or diesel equivalents.Story continuesHowever, from this month, electric cars will need to account for 22pc of every manufacturers sales, which analysts expect to lead to heavy price cuts to encourage consumers.Campaigners have said motorists will continue to
find electric cars too expensive
without government subsidies, which ended in 2022, or other incentives such as cuts to VAT.Auto Trader said demand for used electric cars had picked up as prices fell, suggesting that the vehicles will prove popular once they are no longer more expensive than petrol rivals.It said that used electric cars on its site tended to sell up to five days faster than petrol ones.This month, the Chinese manufacturer BYD
surpassed Tesla as the worlds best-selling electric car maker
. The companys cheapest electric vehicle retails for 25,000 in the UK, roughly double what it costs in China, which Auto Trader said gave it room to further cut prices in Britain.It predicted that one in six electric cars sold in Britain will be made by Chinese companies by 2030.Ian Plummer, Auto Traders commercial director, said motorists had been confused by Rishi Sunaks decision to push back a ban on petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 to 2035.He said that discounts applied to new electric cars meant most motorists would not bear the full cost of the depreciation in their value.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Yahoo Finance,"An overlooked area of the stock market could soar 60% in 2024 with valuations signaling a big run ahead, Fundstrat says",2024-01-18,0.555556,"Cindy Ord/Getty ImagesSmall cap stocks could soar as much as 60% in 2024 on compelling valuations, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.
Lee told CNBC on Tuesday that the valuation of small caps relative to the S&P 500 haven't looked this appealing since 1999.
""That was a launch point for 12 years of gains,"" Lee said.An overlooked area of the stock market is set to soar in 2024 after significantly underperforming the
S&P 500
last year, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.In an interview on Tuesday, Lee
told CNBC
that small cap stocks could soar as much as 60% this year thanks to compelling valuations relative to the S&P 500.""I think small caps could make a bigger move [than large cap stocks], you know 50% or 60%. I think the Russell 2000 could end the year above 3,000,"" Lee said. The Russell 2000 traded at around 1,910 on Wednesday.The
Russell 2000
trailed the S&P 500 significantly in 2023, gaining about 17% compared to a gain of about 24% for the large cap index. That underperformance has spilled over into 2024. Year-to-date, the Russell 2000 is down about 7% compared to a 1% drop for the S&P 500.But Lee said that valuation measures make the small cap Russell 2000 index much more compelling when compared to the S&P 500.""Small caps relative to the S&P 500 on a price-to-book basis is back to where it was in 1999, which was the absolute low and was a launch point of 12 years of outperformance for small caps,"" Lee said.Lee has called small cap stocks his best idea for 2024, in part because of the idea that participation in the ongoing stock market rally is improving and is no longer concentrated in just mega-cap tech stocks, like it was in 2023. If so-called breadth improves in the stock market, then small cap stocks should catch a bid, Lee said in his 2024 outlook.Lee also said
in his 2024 outlook
that three factors could help boost small-cap stocks in 2024.First, fund flows into the stock market are necessary for small cap stocks to outperform, according to Lee. If retail funds aren't flowing into the stock market, then funds likely aren't flowing into small cap stocks. That could change in 2024 as investors start to warm up to the stock market.Story continuesSecond, small cap stocks are highly levered and tend to have a higher cost of capital, so a decline in interest rates should benefit small cap stocks much more than large cap stocks.Finally, an expansion in economic growth could be a ""huge tailwind"" for small cap stocks as they are highly exposed to the domestic economy.Read the original article on

Even now, it's still a pretty elusive achievement.As of this writing, only five companies in the U.S. stock market have market caps greater than $1 trillion, and only seven more are over halfway there. But it's safe to say that the list of trillion-dollar companies could get much longer by the end of the decade.For this discussion, I'm only considering stocks that have a
long
way to go to join the trillion-dollar club. As an example, I'd argue that

""It looks like a negotiation.""In a post on X

Set in 2018, Musk's pay package has the potential to add up to more than $50 billion.Story continuesThe conditional gains were so large that
a shareholder lawsuit filed the same year
alleged the plan constituted corporate waste and unjust enrichment, and that board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the plan. The trial was held in November 2022, and post-trial briefings and arguments are complete, according to Tesla's SEC filings.Musk said on X that ""the Tesla board is great. The reason for no new 'compensation plan' is that we are still waiting for a decision in my Delaware compensation case.""His push for greater control is significant because Tesla's board has
long drawn criticism

prompted even loyal investors to criticize the board
for not holding Musk accountable.""Its time for Teslas board to wake up and do their job,""

That has the potential to cloud their judgment when deciding on matters that could pit the interests of shareholders against those of Musk, the individual.That the board is comprised of several Musk allies also challenges the notion that the institution serves as an independent overseer of the executive, rather than as an advisory committee, or worse, as enablers with a sibling, friends, and business allies among the group.Here's a look at who sits on the company's board"
