Investing.com,Federal Government Runs Another Deficit Despite Record Revenue,2024-02-13,0.333333,"By Mike Maharrey, Money Metals Exchange
The federal government's budget deficit was only $21.93 billion in January.
That was a significant improvement over the $129 billion shortfall recorded in December.
But dont throw the confetti.
The smaller deficit was primarily due to increased government receipts thanks to a big drop in tax refunds. But the Biden administration is still spending like a drunken sailor. (No disrespect to drunken sailors.)
Meanwhile, interest payments on the rapidly ballooning national debt continue to expand at breakneck speed.
Through the first four months of fiscal 2024, the federal government ran a $531.86 trillion deficit, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That is a 16 percent increase over the same period in fiscal 2023.
These massive monthly budget shortfalls are pushing the national debt higher at a dizzying pace. On December 29, the national debt eclipsed $34 trillion for the first time. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5, the national debt stood at a ""mere"" $31.46 trillion. As of Feb. 9, the national debt stood at $34.2 trillion.
According to the CBO, debt held by the public is projected to balloon from $26.2 trillion to $48.3 trillion by the end of 2034. That would represent 116 percent of GDP and would be the highest level on record.The federal government is a little like a drunk dude up late shopping on Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
).
The Treasury reported $477.32 billion in receipts last month, a January record. Collection of payroll and income tax withholdings helped boost government revenue. The IRS has also cleared a backlog of delayed income tax filings from the pandemic year.
But even with this revenue windfall, the U.S. government still ran a deficit. Thats because it is addicted to spending money.
In January, the U.S. Biden administration blew through $499.25 billion, also a January record.These big budget deficits are happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills, and it is likely one of the reasons that the Federal Reserve is talking about rate cuts. The borrow-and-spend U.S. government cant function in a high interest-rate environment.
The U.S. government spent $69.2 billion on interest expenses alone in January. This was more than the amount spent on national defense ($60 billion) and more than healthcare ($68 billion).
Interest on the federal debt came in $96 billion higher through the first four months of the fiscal year than in the same period last year. The government has shelled out $357 billion on interest payments in fiscal 2023. The only category with higher spending was Social Security.
Net interest expense, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, was $283 billion through the first four months of the fiscal year, still nearly as much as the government spent on national defense ($298 billion).
And interest expense will only continue to climb.
Much of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month, some of that super-low-yielding paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates.
The weighted average interest rate on the governments outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.21 percent as of the end of January. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.43 percent in January 2022.
Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words, the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
And it's only going to get worse unless the Fed quickly ratchets down interest rates.
Interest expense will continue to rise at a rapid rate as more and more Treasuries mature and are replaced by higher-yielding bonds.
The only way out of this fiscal death spiral is significant spending cuts and/or major tax hikes.
I wouldnt hold my breath.
And I would hold on to my confetti."

prices  from $2.2 to $2 for a MMBTU. However, I foresee that the price may become even lower. With a sharp reduction of exports, the price of gas will fall to the range of $1.5 - 1.8.
What are the main reasons for this price decrease? Between 2009 and 2022, the drilling speed saw a fivefold increase. The studied area has expanded, allowing for precise well modeling. Moreover, equipment productivity and capacity have risen, accompanied by a reduction in equipment costs. Consequently, the expense of drillhole construction has halved, while productivity has surged ten times.
The new low price will stop both the introduction of new wells and drilling increase. And accordingly, there will be a cut in production for the month and price stabilization. The excess gas will be pumped into the underground storage. The injection can be kept there for a month and during this period there will be a decline in production. Subsequently, in spite of the current drop, we can expect the average gas price in 2024 in the United States at the level of $2.6 - 2.8 for a MMBtu."

Investing.com,The Ninja Price Increase - Shrinkflation,2024-01-16,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
You know all about price inflation and how it squeezes your wallet. But there are also ninja price increases out there that you might not notice. It's called ""shrinkflation.""
Inflation robs you of purchasing power by driving up the price of everything you buy. The government reports price inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) but it's a lot worse than they're telling you.
In the first place, the CPI is rigged to understate the extent of price inflation. You probably realize this every time you go to the store.
But price inflation also manifests itself in ways a government formula could never capture, and you may not even notice. Not only do you pay more for everything you buy, you get less.Literally.
And that's called shrinkflation.
Consumers aren't the only ones struggling with rising prices. Producers have to deal with them as well. The cost of materials, labor, and equipment go up, putting the squeeze on companies' bottom lines. Eventually, they have to pass those costs on to their customers.
But raising prices isn't a popular move. Ideally, a company would love to hide the price increase from you.
Enter shrinkflation.
Instead of raising the price, the company just gives you less for the same amount of money. It does this by shrinking packages or putting less stuff in the same size container.Shrinkflation doesnt show up in the CPI, and most of the time, you probably dont even notice. But the effect is the same as rising prices. You ultimately end up with less stuff.
It is stealth inflation.
Here's a recent example courtesy of Campbell's Soup.But as my friend astutely pointed out, it is ""part and parcel"" of a bigger picture and it reveals exactly what the government is doing to your money as a matter of policy.
The devaluation of the dollar manifests itself everywhere in ways we dont even expect or measure. The consumer price index measures inflation charitably by allowing, at their discretion, for the use of substitute goods and services to offset price increases. There are no aggregate metrics to account for the decrease in quality of goods, for shrinkflation, and the precipitous declines were experiencing in the quality and formerly personal nature of important services.
MousePrint.org chronicles shrinkflation. Here are some recent examples.Most of the time, consumers don't even notice shrinkflation. But when they do, they get mad. And their anger is usually directed at the greedy corporations that are charging them the same for less.
But there's another culprit.
The Federal Reserve.
Price inflation is a symptom of monetary inflation. As the central bank creates money out of thin air and injects it into the economy, prices generally rise. Economist Murray Rothbard noted that since governments have deemed paper tickets and ""computer digits"" money, then the government, as dominant money-supplier, becomes free to create money costlessly and at will. As a result, this inflation of the money supply destroys the value of the dollar or pound, drives up prices, cripples economic calculation, and hobbles and seriously damages the workings of the market economy.
Companies can't just ignore their cost problems. They can either raise prices, which will make you mad, or shrink package sizes, which will still make you mad, but you might not notice.
But the end result is always the same. You end up paying more and getting less."
Investing.com,Biden Admin. Runs Half Trillion Dollar Deficit in Q1 of Fiscal 2024,2024-01-12,0.222222,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Just one quarter into fiscal 2024, the federal government has already run a budget deficit of over half a trillion dollars.
The December budget shortfall came in at $129.37 billion, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That drove the 2024 deficit to $509.94 billion. Thats a 21 percent increase over the first quarter deficit in fiscal 2023.
This follows on the heels of the third-largest annual budget deficit in history (1.7 trillion).
These massive monthly budget shortfalls are pushing the national debt higher at a dizzying pace. On December 29, the national debt eclipsed $34 trillion for the first time. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5, the national debt stood at a ""mere"" $31.46 trillion.President Joe Biden blames Republican tax cuts under the Trump administration for the ever-widening budget deficit, but the numbers dont bear this out. Federal receipts were just under $1.1 trillion in the first quarter. Thats 12 percent higher than through the first three months of fiscal 2023.
Federal revenue did decline in fiscal 2023 after a windfall in 2022. According to a Tax Foundation analysis of Congressional Budget Office data, federal tax collections were up 21 percent in fiscal 22. Tax collections also came in at a multi-decade high of 19.6 percent as a share of GDP. But at the time, CBO analysts warned the good times wouldnt last.
And they didnt.
Government receipts fell by 9.3 percent in fiscal 2023. Even so, receipts are up so far this year even as the deficit climbed.
The real problem is on the spending side of the ledger. Over the last two years, the Biden administration has blown through roughly half a trillion every single month.
Through the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the federal government spent $1.62 trillion. Thats a 12 percent increase over the first three months of last year.Excessive borrowing and spending is a bipartisan sport.
This underscores the fact that the fundamental issue isnt that the U.S. government doesnt have enough money. The fundamental problem is that the U.S. government spends too much money. Despite the pretend spending cuts, and promises from the Biden administration that it would save hundreds of billions the debt ceiling deal (aka the [misnamed]
Fiscal Responsibility Act
) didnt address that problem. No matter what you hear about spending cuts, the federal government always finds new reasons to spend more money.These big budget deficits are happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills, and it is likely one of the reasons that the Federal Reserve is talking about rate cuts even though the CPI remains well above the mythical 2 percent target. The borrow-and-spend U.S. government cant function in a high interest-rate environment.
Uncle Sam spent $288.01 billion in interest expense to finance the national debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. That was more than national defense ($238 billion) and more than Medicare ($168 billion). The only higher spending category was Social Security at $351 billion.
Net interest expense, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, was $216 billion in Q1, still nearly as much as the government spent on national defense.
Much of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month, some of that super-low-yielding paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates. The weighted average interest rate on the governments outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.17 percent as of the end of December. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.32 percent in December 2022.
Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words, the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
And it's only going to get worse.
Interest expense will continue to rise at a rapid rate as more and more Treasuries mature and are replaced by higher-yielding bonds.
The only way out of this fiscal death spiral is significant spending cuts and/or major tax hikes. Congress doesnt seem to have the political will for either."
Investing.com,The Common Definition of Inflation Is Wrong - It's Just Government Propaganda,2024-01-12,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
The Consumer Price Index for December came in hotter than expected but its a lot lower than it was a year ago. That means inflation is decreasing, right?
Not so fast.
Its important to understand that the term inflation as bandied about by government people and the mainstream financial media is vague and imprecise. The word simply means an increase. But an increase in what?When government officials and pundits on TV talk about inflation, they almost always mean price inflation. This is what the CPI attempts to measure  how much prices have generally gone up in the economy. When you hear Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell or some other government official talk about cooling inflation, theyre simply saying that prices are not rising as fast as measured by the CPI.
But historically, inflation didnt mean rising prices. Inflation was defined more precisely as an increase in the amount of money and credit in the economy, or more succinctly, an expansion in the money supply.Economist Ludwig von Mises defined it this way in his essay ""
Inflation: An Unworkable Fiscal Policy
.""
Inflation, as this term was always used everywhere and especially in this country, means increasing the quantity of money and bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check.
A 1970s dictionary offered this definition of inflation.
A sharp increase in the amount of money and credit causing advances in the price level.
Notice in this definition that rising prices are the result of inflation  not inflation itself.
This is an extremely important distinction that has been almost entirely erased in the modern definition of inflation.
Henry Hazlitt is best known for his brilliant book 
Economics in One Lesson
. In another essay titled 
Inflation in One Page,
 he explained why using a more precise definition of inflation is crucial.
Inflation is an increase in the quantity of money and credit. Its chief consequence is soaring prices.
Therefore inflationif we misuse the term to mean the rising prices themselvesis caused solely by printing more money. For this the governments monetary policies are entirely responsible.Over the years, government officials, along with government apologists in the mainstream financial media and academia, intentionally shifted the definition of inflation to suit government purposes. The standard definition of inflation you hear during White House press conferences or a CNBC roundtable is basically just government propaganda.
Hazlitt alludes to the reason for this intentional change in definition. Redefining inflation as rising prices allows government people to shift the blame.
Mises explained it this way.
People today use the term `inflation' to refer to the phenomenon that is an inevitable consequence of inflation, that is the tendency of all prices and wage rates to rise.
The result of this deplorable confusion is that there is no term left to signify the cause of this rise in prices and wages. There is no longer any word available to signify the phenomenon that has been, up to now, called inflation As you cannot talk about something that has no name, you cannot fight it.
Those who pretend to fight inflation are in fact only fighting what is the inevitable consequence of inflation, rising prices. Their ventures are doomed to failure because they do not attack the root of the evil. They try to keep prices low while firmly committed to a policy of increasing the quantity of money that must necessarily make them soar.
As long as this terminological confusion is not entirely wiped out, there cannot be any question of stopping inflation.By obscuring the fact that price inflation (a general rise in all prices) is the result of monetary inflation, government and central bank officials can blame inflation on all kinds of things. After all, there are a lot of reasons certain prices go up and certain prices go down.
For example, spiking oil prices after the invasion of Ukraine werent technically inflation. It would be better described as a price shock. Price shocks do, in fact, raise prices. And those price increases can cascade through the economy, causing other prices to rise with them.
But unlike price increases due to monetary inflation, decreases in other areas of the economy will generally balance out price shocks (absent inflation) as people shift spending patterns.
If people have to pay more for gasoline, they may cancel vacation plans or quit eating out. This drop in demand will cause hotel and restaurant prices to fall even as fuel prices rise.
In contrast, theres only one thing that will cause a
general
rise in prices with no corresponding price decreases - an increase in the money supply - what we used to define as inflation.
Milton Friedman summed it up.
[Inflation] is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. Its always and everywhere a result of too much money.
But thanks to the change in definition, there is no word for the thing that causes price inflation  money printing. Instead, were told corporate greed, or Putins price hikes, or consumer expectations, or a strong economy are causing prices to rise.
If we use the traditional definition of inflation, the culprit becomes clear.
Who expands the money supply?
The Fed and the federal government.
When you accurately define inflation, you know exactly who to blame. But if the people responsible for your pain can fool you into believing that the symptom of inflation
is
inflation, they get to wiggle off the hook."
Investing.com,The Demise of Price Inflation Seems Somewhat Exaggerated,2024-01-11,0.555556,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
No matter what you read about the December Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, you should keep one important fact top of mind: every number is far above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
Given that fact, it would seem the death of price inflation seems somewhat exaggerated.
The headline CPI for December came out hotter than expected. Prices rose 0.3 percent month-on-month, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The expectation was for a 0.2 percent increase.
That pushed that annual CPI up to 3.4 percent from 3.1 percent in November.
Stripping out more volatile food and energy prices, core CPI rose by 0.3 percent. That equaled the 0.3 percent increase in November but was in line with estimates. The annual core CPI came in at 3.9 percent, down a tick from 4 percent the prior month.
It's worth noting that core CPI has been hovering in the 4 percent range since July and remains nearly double the Fed's 2 percent target.
To put the monthly core CPI increase in perspective, it would need to average just under 0.17 percent per month to hit the 2 percent annual target.
Keep in mind, inflation is worse than the government data suggest. The government revised the CPI formula in the 1990s so that it understates the actual rise in prices. Based on the formula used in the 1970s, CPI is closer to double the official numbers.
Digging more deeply into the numbers, rising shelter costs drove the overall CPI higher last month. Shelter prices rose 0.5 percent month-on-month and 6.2 percent on an annual basis.
Energy prices also reversed in December, charting a 0.4 gain after sliding 2.3 percent in November.
Food prices continue to creep up month after month. The food index rose 0.2 percent month-on-month, matching the November increase. On an annual basis, food prices rose 3.4 percent (not seasonally adjusted).The higher-than-expected headline CPI dampened hope for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, although many market analysts tried to spin the CPI report as ""not that bad.""
Capital Economics chief North American economist Paul Ashworth told
MarketWatch
that the December CPI report doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. He said two big drivers of the CPI increase - used cars and shelter - will likely reverse in the coming months.In short, we dont think Decembers CPI data necessarily rules out a March rate cut by the Fed.
Principal Asset Management chief global strategist Seema Shah was less sanguine.
Todays inflation report reinforces the notion that the market had gotten a little overexcited around the timing of rate cuts. These are not bad numbers, but they do show that disinflation progress is still slow and unlikely to be a straight line down to 2 percent.
But she still penciled in rate cuts as early as mid-2024.
This optimism despite the actual CPI data underscores the fact that the markets are desperate for rate cuts because most people recognize that the debt-riddled economy can't function long-term with interest rates at this level.
We're already seeing signs of strain. There were more corporate bankruptcies in 2023 than there were during the pandemic year of 2020.It's important to recognize the mainstream wants the Fed to claim victory over inflation so it can go back to inflationary policies. In effect, an end to rate increases, subsequent rate cuts, and loosening monetary policy will eventually lead to more price inflation.
In other words, as soon as the Fed declares victory, inflation wins.
How?
Because rising prices are a symptom of monetary inflation. And monetary inflation is exactly what we will get when the central bank reverts to a looser monetary policy.
In fact, despite the rate hikes, the Fed hasnt been nearly as aggressive in tightening monetary policy as you might think. From a historical perspective, financial conditions remain loose.
The Chicago Fed Financial Conditions Index confirms this. The NFCI ticked down to 0.51 in the week ending Jan. 5. A negative number indicates loose conditions.
Despite the fact rate hikes have cooled CPI in recent months, the Fed is still a long way from victory. And yet the mainstream remains convinced victory is imminent. The fact is, victory isn't even in the cards. It's more like surrender."

Instead of following that script, weve seen blowout employment figures, inflation seemingly reaccelerating, and the Fed pushing back on expectations for interest rate cuts in March. Tomorrows US CPI report is the next big test to see if the nascent trend of US economic exceptionalism in 2024 continues.Digging into the data, headline CPI has clearly seen its decline stall over the last couple of quarters, with the year-over-year measure actually increasing from 3.0% to 3.4% over the last six months. That said, the Fed is more concerned with the Core CPI reading, which is seen as more indicative of underlying price pressures and has continued to edge lower in recent months.One of the best leading indicators for inflation is the Prices component of the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI surveys. Historically, a simple average of these two components has been a relatively reliable predictor of CPI readings 3-6 months into the future, as the chart below shows:Source: TradingView, StoneXWhile it wont necessarily impact CPI dramatically this month, the most recent round of PMI surveys showed prices increasing for 58.5% of respondents across the two surveys, suggesting that inflation could well tick up as we move into the Spring. This is no doubt a concern for the Fed and may lead to a smaller-than-expected reaction even if this weeks (lagging) CPI reading comes in below expectations.Notably,
traders are not necessarily expecting a massive move on the back of this months CPI report

If bulls are able to overcome that resistance level (potentially on the back of a hotter-than-expected US CPI report), the pair has little in the way of technical resistance until closer to 152.00.

That was generally the 2013 to 2019 era generally attended by a strong US dollar.To this day, the dogs devour every morsel thrown their way and their confidence in our monetary regulators is intact, by definition. Every time a still-hot economic or inflation signal comes in the market quakes in its boots, and that includes the anti-bubble, gold. Confidence = intact. Gold is for when intact becomes unglued.Hence, the only thing a right-minded market participant can do (excluding the vast majority who still think its normal as their financial advisers continue to cost average up into nosebleed territory) is not short it in a committed fashion, play it from the long side with risk management or sit and collect the cash income that the Fed is paying you to take advantage of.As for speculating from the long side, what has been working best over the last year is what we originally projected a year ago, the Goldilocks stuff, as a market in full submission to the Feds every utterance from its various orifices continues to view cost-push inflation implied in the January Payrolls report and even a slight uptick in Manufacturing (well take a brief look at the latest ISM in this weekends NFTRH report) with fear of the Fed, which in turn has been driving the US dollar.So confidence is intact, by definition. Markets are flat-out bullish. AI is going to make us all rich (well, I sold SMCI too soon, collecting
only
a +/- 70% profit on two separate trades). Actually, I had to sell SMCI just as I had to sell ANET before it because my DNA directs me not to be a hype follower and by extension, anything resembling a committed bubble player.This graph produced by John Hussman was taken from a more extensive article, which you may want to check out. Feel free to reference the NFTRH Links page any time, as youll find Doc Hussman and many other worthwhile sources there (market tools, economic data, industry news/analysis, biased and unbiased analysis alike, and so much more). Ive built that links page for my own reference. Why not bookmark it for yourself?Here Hussman illustrates in one picture that our bullish markets and strong economy are the products of leverage. In an ongoing bubble this does not matter. In a bursting bubble? Well, it matters.So the above is a bullish picture at high risk because it is the product of leverage to a growing debt pile and by extension, deficits. That is what the economy and associated bull market are built upon. Play it if you will, but also understand it for what it is.For those submitting to the Feds every utterance (not to mention to their mainstream financial advisers assurances that they are professionally managing their wealth in the ways of tradition), its all good as long as the bubble in policy and associated markets and thus,
confidence
are intact.Other indicators we use in NFTRH show what we have been noting for months; that the market is two things 1) bullish and 2) at high risk. To save room for a more pointed discussion about individual equities and strategy in the upcoming
NFTRH 796
, Ill drop a cavalcade of our indicators in this public article for subscribers and the public alike to review.Again, I want to remind you that the Goldilocks link above is from a year ago when nobody else was talking Goldilocks and a relative few were talking bullish in general. I point that out because when I write highly negative articles like I perceive this one to be, proven credibility (that Ive not been a perma-bear, perma-bug, or perma anything else to this point) is important. I simply have to write about what I see and I dont care whose agenda it may or may not serve.On that note, risk is play in the form of sentiment and in the form of other indicators like the extreme low in the defensive Healthcare sector to the broad
SPX
. The
XLV
/SPY ratio has historically and reliably spiked upward into and during bear markets and hard corrections. The exception was 2012  2016 when there was a lot of healthcare-related political noise in the picture. The ratio shows
high risk to equities and yet a still bullish situation
.Speaking of a still bullish situation, the
Semiconductor > Tech > Broad
leadership chain has been a staple in NFTRH, keeping us from attempting an active bearish orientation and/or keeping us with a bullish view (risk and all).
SOX
leading
NDX
and NDX leading SPX is the bullish leadership recipe. Its intact, if not yet fully baked.As for gold, it is not yet signaling either a bear market or an illegitimate * bull market for stocks. During the un-shaded period from 2002 to 2011 the stock market spent the majority of the time in an apparent bull market. Stocks were going up! Gold went up better. Currently, SPX/Gold shows stock bulls sleeping soundly.* Well, thats debatable considering the majority of charts in this article.
But work with me here.However, the
Copper
/Gold ratio shows that aside from the strong dollar/Goldilocks stuff, a down economic cycle and stock market bear are just itching to come into play. Post-election, perhaps? Can they hold it together that long?
NFTRH 795
put on its tin foil hat last weekend and took a hard look at that question, both pros and cons.Meanwhile, another risk indicator to a still bullish market situation is the current state of the
VIX
vs. the bulling SPX. Its not a major thing, visually. But historically the VIX has tended to travel at least flat with a positive bias prior to SPX corrections. Today? Well, VIX is traveling with a positive bias in defiance of the big bull move in SPX.We anticipated, if not predicted a bull move in SPX, after all. Here is a chart Ive shown publicly on several occasions as 2023 went about its business of building a higher-risk situation with the desired ingredient to make a truly high-risk situation a higher high in SPX. The anticipation was for anything from a slightly higher high double top to an upside suck em in FOMO extravaganza and upside blow-off. The market is agitating for the latter now.With respect to the above, ironically the recent bump up in Fed hawkishness could sustain the bull longer than if they had remained stapled to the March rate cut view. Its when the Fed is finally compelled to start cutting to get in line with the declining
2-year yield
that max bear damage has been inflicted. I dont say so. The chart and history say so.There are many more indicators we use. From Libor Yields to High Yield Spreads to yield curves and more that are currently telling us theGold, not mentioned much in this article, nonetheless lays in wait for the post-bubble *. Ill continue to respect the idea that a major post-bubble indicator kicked in in 2022. That would be in the in the form of the king of NFTRH indicators, the Continuum, which after years of keeping us aware that inflationary policymakers were in full control (the Continuum indicated pleasant disinflation, after all) smashed its limiting moving averages. And you wonder why todays Fed is so zealous about fighting inflation?* Post-bubble will be the only macro that will sustain an extended and potentially epic move in the gold mining industry because by then the gold mining products relationship to cyclical and risk on asset markets will leverage the miners bottom lines to the upside. This is the Bob Hoye playbook, but its been elusive over the bubble years (decades) and its still not quite time yet."
Investing.com,"Stocks, Rates Stall at Key Resistances",2024-02-09,0.666667,"So, it was another rather boring day, with the
S&P 500
finishing flat, rates up, the
dollar
up, and implied volatility somewhat higher. This has been a very odd earnings season.Last night, I noted a rising wedge in the S&P 500, and as of yesterdays close, the index is pretty much out of room.There might be a little bit more time it could buy, but not much. As I mentioned yesterday, these patterns are bearish by definition.However, just because something is bearish doesnt mean it has to break lower.Normally, I would have much more confidence in this pattern, but given how difficult the last four months have been for my S&P 500 views, I am quite hesitant about it.If the pattern breaks lower, then it could retrace back to its origin at 4850. Where it goes from there, I would have to see.If it reaches 4,850, a lot can start to happen because I have numerous trend lines converging in that region. If these trend lines begin to break, things could start to happen.I noted earlier that implied volatility somewhat increased yesterday, and thats because the
VIX
was essentially flat, but the VVIX rose by 3% to 83, marking an increase for two consecutive days.Sometimes, when the VVIX starts to rise, the VIX isnt too far behind.The VVIX measures the implied volatility of the VIX, and when the implied volatility of the VIX starts to rise, it suggests to me that something is happening beneath the surface to cause this.Part of the reason why we see the VIX remain below 13 to 14 is due to the significant gamma buildup around the options expiration next Wednesday, yes, February 14th.Its unusual to see the VIX options expiration (OPEX) occur on the second Wednesday of the month, but thats what the calendar indicates.I bring this up because its interesting to observe implied volatility levels rising from beneath, while options flows are helping to keep the VIX contained.Meanwhile, the
30-year bond
auction yesterday went fine, yet we still saw the 30-year and the
10-year
rates move higher.The 10-year is very close to breaking out and rising above the 4.20% region. If that happens, I think we could see it rise to around 4.35% to start with.Im also keeping an eye on the
Mexican Peso
, of all things, because it looks like a double bottom is in the process of forming, mixed in with a diamond reversal pattern.Theres solid momentum forming on the RSI, which has been pushing higher since June.When you invert the peso, it becomes easier to see the relationship between the Peso and the S&P 500.These relationships between the S&P 500 and currencies seem to exist widely and are a function of the dollar's weakening and strengthening.This emphasizes how much of the market movements have to do with changes in financial conditions. It is also evident that the S&P 500 and the peso are diverging.Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) is also diverging from the S&P 500 and appears to be in a more bearish formation than the S&P 500. A close below $186 likely sets up a drop back to around $167.It almost looks like Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) has broken the neckline of a head and shoulders pattern.Its not clear at this point, but I can easily get the impression that if this is indeed the confirmation of the pattern, then the losses in the stock arent over yet.Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) exhibited a notable reversal candle yesterday, after moving above yesterdays high and then closing below yesterdays close.However, given how overbought it is, and the fact that the call wall for the stock for this week and next week is at $700, theres probably a good reason why the stock has struggled in this region over the last four days.AnywayYouTube Video Original Post"
Investing.com,S&P 500,2024-02-08,0.666667,"I must say that writing these days is a real challenge, and yesterday was one of those days, mostly because it was just more of the same with the troubling three continuing to lead the charge.There is just nothing else to say there.Is it a rising wedge that is forming in the
S&P 500
? It looks like one. Does it mean anything? Not sure.The definition of a rising wedge is a bearish pattern that begins wide at the bottom and contracts as it moves higher. So, it fits that definition.On top of that, we have divergences all over the place, most notably in the
dollar
. It has certainly been the case when looking at the inverse of the
Swiss Franc
.The inverse of the 1-month implied correlation index is also going in the opposite direction of the S&P 500.Meanwhile, there has been a divergence between the S&P 500 and
HYG
junk bond ETF.There used to be a time when reserve balances even mattered, and to this point, those have stopped going higher as well.Financial conditions have even stopped easing.Even the number of stocks above their 50-day moving average has been diverging.So, unless the equity market has figured out a way to decouple itself from rates, the dollar, financial conditions, and everything else, the insanity of the last four months should be about over. I have nothing left to add.YouTube Video Original Post"
Investing.com,S&P 500 E-Mini to Test All-Time Highs?,2024-02-05,0.555556,"The monthly chart is forming an
S&P 500 Emini
test all-time high. The bulls hope that the market will reach the all-time high and break out above. The bears want a reversal from a lower high major trend reversal or a double top and a large wedge pattern (Dec 2, July 27, and Feb 2) forming at the trend channel line area."
Investing.com,NFP Preview,2024-02-02,0.666667,"Stocks rebounded yesterday ahead of todays job report, with
expectations
for 185,000 new jobs to have been created, down from 216,000 last month.Meanwhile, the
unemployment rate
is expected to tick higher to around 3.8% from 3.7% last month, while
wage growth
is expected to drop to 0.3% in January from 0.4% in December and
stay steady
at 4.1% y/y.Remember, last year, we got that shock January job report that was much better than expected.We saw the
S&P 500
rebound yesterday and managed to stall at 4900; it was the spot where the index opened yesterday.Given the results from Meta (NASDAQ:
META
) and its big move higher, it seems we could fill that gap today, as long as the jobs report comes in ok and has no surprises.I remained focused on the Implied Volatility levels for the Mag7 names and the S&P 500 and see how this plays out.Im not sure how the movement in Meta will play into this because the shares are up a lot after it announced a dividend and added on its share buyback program.Meta released results that were much better than expected, which I would call shock-and-awe on the revenue beat and even the guidance for revenue next quarter.The new dividend was a surprise, so the stock is up 14% after hours. Some of this may have been done to overshadow the higher capex and higher-than-expected expenses.The company sees a capex of $30 to $37 billion in 2024 versus estimates of $33.4 billion.The company also sees total expenses at $94 to $99 billion versus estimates of $96.4 billion. The move up seems like a lot to me, so it will be interesting to see if all the gains hold.Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) is trading up 7.5% after hours, which also seems like a lot, considering AWS missed revenue estimates, coming in at $24.204 billion versus estimates of $24.221 billion.This is fractionally, but considering the size of the beat by Azure, the AWS numbers do not seem to compare as well.The company also guided first-quarter revenue of $138 to $143.5 billion versus estimates of $142 billion.It is just surprising I guess to have seen Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
) go down after it was reported and to see these Amazon AWS numbers for Amazon to go up.I get that operating income was better, but still. I own both Microsoft and Amazon.Of course, Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) reported good numbers on the top and bottom but had horrible numbers out of China, which was a big concern of mine.The company reported China revenue of $20.8 billion versus estimates of $23.5 billion and an 11.4% miss. Services revenue for Apple also missed coming in at $23.1 billion versus estimates of $23.3. billion.Apple does give numbers for guidance, but said it expected revenue to be flat to last year for the fiscal second quarter, versus expectation for 1% growth. The stock is down about 3.5% after hours.So overall, it was just a strange day, and I could imagine today getting stranger with the job report still out there.Original Post"
Investing.com,"US Dollar, Gold Relationship With Silver Could Indicate Next Market Direction",2024-02-02,0.666667,"As FOMC rides into the sunset until March, the
US Dollar Index
is left to fend for itself amid the hawkish (or at least not yet dovish) echos of Jerome Powells assertion that the market should not expect rate cuts in March. Well duh, we know that already, sir.The only benefit the
US dollar
would be left with, assuming the not yet dovish policy does not turn hawkish again, would be the potential for a counter-party bid.An impulsive bid by risk-soaked casino patrons suddenly jerking to a safe haven. Which USD surely is, much like
gold
. The difference being that
USD is a safe haven tool
as long as public confidence in debt paper remains.
Gold is a safe value haven
, long-term.As a tool and with the herds confidence implied to be intact, by virtue of its global reserve status USD receives incoming (forced) investment when herds flee the asset racket, which has been set up counter the US dollar by decades of US and global inflationary monetary policy.Yet here we find a recent disconnect between stocks (
S&P 500
and global, ex-US) and inverse USD. Either USD is going to drop (inverse rise back in line with stocks) or just maybe we might have the start of something important in the form of a fundamental change of character in the macro markets.That could mean market rotation, a stock bear market (SPX has finally joined the new all-time highs! contingent, after all, a preferred ingredient to making a sentiment-fueled top) or, if USD continues to bounce (inverse continues to drop) even a slippery slope into a market liquidation (again, reference all that soft landing, no landing Goldilocks consensus out there in the mainstream financial media for a potential contrary setup).The Gold/Silver ratio (GSR) is still perched constructively to attend USD upward, after all. If gold were to rise impulsively vs. silver the inflation trades would be off and the market liquidation trades could be on.Silver
is less monetary, more speculative, and more cyclical/inflation-sensitive than gold. If the GSR breaks down from this constructive perch, the inflation trades would benefit.Moving on, lets take a brief look at the technical status of the anti-market, the US dollar index (DXY). Much like the bull trap from September to November felt like it took forever and a day to resolve, todays meeting with resistance is a persistent little bugger.Grinding, chewing, and instigating to take out resistance at 103.50. As advised to my subscribers several weeks ago, the key level to exceed and hold (for USD to go bullish) is the December high at 104.27. But first USD is buzz-sawing the resistance area and the important daily SMA 200.The weekly chart provides the perspective that a level of caution, for inflation traders, is provided by the fact that the index held a higher low to the bear trap low with the bounce starting from clear long-term support.If the US dollar index fails to make a higher high to the December high and instead turns down (and silver leads gold upward), then the broad rally can continue, especially in the more traditional inflation trades like commodities and equities that produce commodities/resources, and resource-rich regions within Emerging Markets.If the US dollar index takes out the December high and holds it, and the Gold/Silver ratio follows its current constructive pattern upward, you might want to do a thorough check of the investment pool. The might be a turd in there!To add a third dynamic, there was a blessed phase from 2001 to 2004 when the Gold/Silver ratio rose (non-impulsively), the US dollar declined and the gold mining sector had its most fundamentally pure macro backdrop for years previous and now 20 years since. After that commodities and stock markets rallied as well and the gold miners entered a bubble amid degrading fundamentals. But even a 2 to 3-year phase would be quite profitable."
Investing.com,"Lets Talk Inflation, Post-CPI",2024-02-14,0.333333,"A vast majority of people see inflation as rising prices, wages, and pushed costs within the economy. In other words.Today, we are all, to varying degrees, taking bites out of the Feds excrement.The headlines blare on about CPI, but the inflation problem was created by rapid increases in the money supply. That was the mechanics of inflations
creation
, with too many newly printed currency units seeking out a finite number of assets. That is inflation. Not todays cost effects headlines. This of course is the legacy of our dear monetary leaders, over-schooled in Keynesian theories and eggheads all.Here is the continuum of the Feds legacy, a steadily increasing (M2) money supply that not coincidentally apes the perma-increasing CPI over the long-term; themost recent report for whichis causing Tuesdays market uproar amid intact confidence in (and/or submission to) the great and powerful Fed of Oz.See the little hook upward in M2 of late? Well, consider this input, which was sent to me byNFTRHsubscriber and Austrian monetary expert Michael Pollaro back in January:Gee, do you think that maybe there is an election year political angle in play?Aside from the hype of the day, the trend continues to be disinflationary, benefiting the Biden administration currently in power with its Goldilocks overtones, while behind the curtain the wizard regulates and adjusts his knobs and levers to try to steer the Good Ship Lollipop through a tricky maze of rocks just beneath the surface.As a side note, the Fed is on the surface apolitical, as the same Fed chief oversaw the
creation
of the inflationary bailout under Trump. Its actions have tended to benefit power, regardless of affiliation.Here is the MoM view of the CPI situation. To see what a liquidity crisis looks like, cast your eyes upon the 2020 situation. That was the trigger that sprang the Fed into (inflationary) action. Period. We called it  and the forthcoming inflation trades  back then in real time and sure enough, inflationary effects, so despised and fretted over to this day, also manifested out of that inflationary action.What action, you ask? Well, the action of M2s panicked percentage change from the previous year. Thats what action.So here we are with the culprits being all the stuff lagging within the economy long after the great and powerful Fed of Oz has apparently (but maybe not really) shifted its focus to inflation fighting. Personally, I have lucked out! I no longer need haircuts because I shave my faulty head of hair myself. Also, I got rid of my garbage contractor because they were such a pain in the ass, service wise, that going to the dump once a week is much easier (and way cheaper). Im on easy street, I tell you!All joking aside, this (January CPI components) is the stuff of lag. This is the dreck that clings to the economy years after the Fed rode to the rescue of asset owners by inflating the money supply in epic and historic fashion in 2020.I am not going to sermonize, lecture or screed on. You likely already know the deal if you stay away from mainstream (academic, political and otherwise) brainwashing and simply view the indications of the truth. Its an election year. Much noise will emanate out of the medias orifice just as the Fed is discharging contradictory noises out of its orifice.Central banks (with a big assist from governments fiscal actions) created the post-2020 inflation problem. Period. Now as the Fed tries to clean up its huge share of it, not all is as it appears. Not in the headlines and not in the machinations behind the curtain. That goes for government too, obviously."

Fed Monitor Tool
, while the odds for May stand at about 30%, which is down from over 90% a few weeks ago.Looking out to June, traders believe there is a 75% chance rates will be lower by the end of that meeting.The U.S. consumer price index rose
0.3%
last month after gaining 0.2% in December. In the 12 months through January, the annual CPI increased
3.1%
.That followed a 3.4% advance in December. Economists polled by Investing.com had been looking for a monthly increase of 0.2% and an annual gain of 2.9%.As seen in the chart below, U.S. CPI inflation has come down significantly since the summer of 2022, when it peaked at a 40-year high of 9.1%.Source: Investing.comNonetheless, while the rate of inflation is trending lower, prices are still rising far more quickly than what the Fed would consider consistent with its 2% target range.Excluding the volatile food and energy components, core CPI increased
0.4%
in January after climbing 0.3% in the previous month. On an annual basis, core CPI rose
3.9%
, matching December's increase.Source: Investing.comThe forecast had been for 0.3% and 3.7%, respectively.In a worrying sign, the so-called supercore inflation measure, which tracks the cost of services minus housing and energy, jumped 0.8% on the month, the most since April 2022.Source: ZeroHedgeThe supercore figure is closely watched by Fed officials who believe that it provides a more accurate assessment of the future direction of inflation.Overall, these numbers suggest that the Feds inflation battle is far from over and that policymakers would need to see further progress on sticky underlying core measures before they are comfortable cutting interest rates.Furthermore, any additional reacceleration in consumer prices could risk reigniting talks that the FOMC might even deliver another rate hike after pausing its tightening cycle last year.The Fed recently held its policy rate in the
5.25% to 5.50%
range, where it has been since July 2023.As such, the central bank is likely to keep policy rates higher for longer than markets currently expect as inflation stays elevated, and the economy continues to grow at a solid pace amid a resilient labor market and robust consumer spending.Investors should brace for fresh turmoil in the coming weeks as cracks begin to widen in the early-year rally on Wall Street and the stock market faces a growing risk of a near-term pullback.Looking back on the fourth quarter and the recent rally in stocks, a lot of it was driven by hope and speculation of an imminent Fed rate cut, however, that no longer appears to be the base case with the Fed pivot evaporating before our eyes.As such, I have rebalanced my portfolio of individual stocks and ETFs to reflect a mostly bearish position as I believe Tuesdays negative price action is an inflection point for a more sustained move lower in equities.At the time of writing, I have a short position on the

Investing.com,"Gold Drops Below 2,000, EUR/USD Drops to 3-Month Low on US Inflation Data Release",2024-02-14,0.333333,"The
US Dollar Index
(DXY) rallied sharply and reached a 3-month high on Tuesday, while the gold price plunged.The price of gold fell below the crucial level of 2,000 for the first time since the beginning of 2024 after the US inflation report showed increasing Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, reducing hopes for an early interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed). 'That was not the report that the market wanted to see. Surprisingly stubborn inflation has dropped the chances of a May rate cut to under 50% for the moment,' said Tai Wong, the New York-based independent metals analyst. Indeed, the latest inflation figures make it more likely that Fed policymakers won't reduce interest rates until June. High-interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding gold. Therefore, if interest rates remain high,
XAU/USD
will face downward pressure.XAU/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, no major events on the economic calendar could potentially reverse or extend the new bearish trend in XAU/USD. Traders will be waiting to see how the US Retail Sales report on Thursday and the Producer Price Index report on Friday may shape interest rate expectations. Currently, the technical bias remains bearish as gold trades below the pivotal 2,000 mark.The euro (EUR) lost almost 0.6% on Tuesday after the US data showed that inflation rose more than expected in January. The report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will hold interest rates steady in March and May.Yesterday's data showed that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% month-on-month in January, above the 0.2% increase expected by economists polled by Reuters. Likewise, the increase in the core CPI was higher than expected, immediately reducing the probability of an imminent interest rate cut by the Fed. Currently, the market has completely priced out the chance of a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut in March, considering only a 37% chance of a 25 bps cut in May.The key message from today's CPI is that it's slowing but less than expected. The reading supports the Fed's decision to continue to wait for more assurance that inflation is well contained,' said Dec Mullarkey, the managing director at SLC Management. Investors' long-term interest rate expectations have also shifted. According to the interest rate swap market data, traders expect only 90 bps worth of rate cuts by the Fed and almost 110 bps worth of rate cuts by the European Central Bank in 2024. As a result, the divergence in monetary policy expectations exerts downward pressure on
EUR/USD
.EUR/USD was attempting to recover during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders will probably continue to digest yesterday's data, so the established bearish trend might continue. Additional volatility may be triggered by the release of eurozone Gross Domestic Product figures at 10:00 a.m. UTC. If the numbers are lower than expected, the decline in EUR/USD might deepen, pushing the pair below 1.07000. Otherwise, the pair may rebound, targeting the 1.07600 area.The Australian dollar (AUD) plunged by 1.8% on Tuesday as the US Dollar Index (DXY) surged to a 3-month high on a higher-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.Tuesday's US inflation report surprised the market, significantly shifting investors' expectations for the US interest rate path. The Australian dollar, being a highly risk-sensitive currency, suffered the most among the major currencies. The market no longer expects the Federal Reserve (Fed) to deliver a rate cut this spring. Instead, investors are pricing in a near 50% probability of a 25 basis point (bps) rate reduction in June. Still, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) seems even less dovish than the Fed. According to interest rate swap market data, the market expects only 24 bps worth of rate cuts by the RBA in 2024. Thus, the sell-off in
AUD/USD
appears overextended as the divergence in monetary policy expectations between the Fed and RBA favours the AUD.AUD/USD rose strongly during the Asian and early European sessions but remained below the important 0.65000 level. Today, the economic calendar is uneventful for AUD/USD, so the pair may stay under bearish pressure as long as it moves below 0.65000. However, the release of the Australian Labour Force Survey at 12:30 a.m. UTC tomorrow may stoke extra volatility in AUD pairs. 'The RBA will be hoping to see some softness in the Australian employment data tomorrow, given that a tight labour market remains a source of inflationary pressure,' said Tim Waterer, the chief market analyst at KCM Trade. If the labour report is weaker than expected, AUD/USD will probably continue to decline, but 0.64400 will offer strong support. Conversely, higher-than-expected employment figures may push the pair above 0.65000."
Investing.com,CPI Fallout,2024-02-14,0.666667,"This is the reason that serious people dont choose a trend length that happens to fit with their narrative.For the last few months, supposedly serious economists have crowed about how the 3-month average of seasonally-adjusted
CPI
was at a new post-COVID low.(Most of those same economists, only a few months ago, were focused on the 6-month average, but when that started crawling higher they switched to the 3-month average.)And indeed, it was exciting. Headline CPI was down to 1.89% on a seasonally adjusted three-month average;
core CPI
was at 3.30%.Victory over inflation was proclaimed! Inflation was back at target, even a bit below, so the Fed should start easing policy forthwith.Fortunately, and maybe surprisingly, Chairman Powell is built of stronger stuff.As a Cliffs Notes guide to what youre going to read: all of those folks who loved the 3-month average when it was 1.89%, arent going to be as vocal about it now that its at 2.80%.Core, on a 3-month average basis, is at 3.92%. The 6-month averages also rose.Now, this doesnt mean that inflation is necessarily headed back higher yet. Ill get to that in a bit, but I will allow how the picture of
m/m core
CPI, below, might be perceived by some as discouraging.Before this figure, the consensus was for a fairly strong report, 0.16% on headline and 0.28% on core. I thought it would be
softer
because rents based on my model should start to decelerate soon.But, as I said in my podcast, if rents were high then you should look past rents. Theyre going to decelerate over the next 6 months or so, to around 3% y/y, and then re-accelerate.Thats all baked in the cake, and it will flatter the inflation data. But it hasnt happened yet! OER was a massive +0.56% m/m.Primary Rents were more in line with what I was looking for, with a small deceleration to +0.36% m/m from +0.39% last month.The indices are still decelerating just not as rapidly as I think anyone (myself included now!) expected.Lodging Away from Home was +1.78%, which was a big m/m figure and contributed to the overall housing subindex being +0.62% m/m at a time when shelter
should
be decelerating.But as I said, if this surprise was all OER then we can look past it.Core Goods was weak, which was a downside surprise. Used Cars fell -3.37% m/m, which is far worse than any surveys saw this month.But as I pointed out last month, Used Cars had been surprisingly
strong
compared to the private surveys so this is partly a make-up and it contributed to the weakness in Core Goods.Medicinal Drugs were also weak, -0.54% m/m and thats also in Core Goods. Overall, Core Goods  which had shown some signs of life  dropped back to deflation y/y this month.Going forward, I dont think core goods will stay in deflation.Partly, thats because supply chains are being stressed again due to drought in the Panama Canal and the effective shutting of the Red Sea to container traffic, but its also partly because there is continued interest in nearshoring which will raise costs (after all, it was to
lower
costs that firms offshored stuff in the first place.And then theres also this, for the medium term. To be sure, this level of growth in Personal Consumption in the past was consistent with mild deflation  but that was pre-nearshoring.The direction is what Im interested in, but I also think that for a given amount of
PCE
growth, we will see more core goods inflation in the future.So now we turn to the really interesting part of the report, and thats core services ex-shelter. Ive been saying for a while that this category was going to be a sticky wicket because wages are still rising at a 5% y/y pace.And indeed, the wicket is sticky. This month, airfares rose +1.4% (this may have been related to jet fuel tightness on the East Coast), but also again we saw a continued acceleration to Hospital Services, which rose to the highest y/y rate (+6.7%) since 2011.Overall, core services ex-shelter (so-called Supercore) rose +0.85% m/m, the biggest rise in a couple of years, and the y/y measure is in an upswing.Overall, this report is deflating pun absolutely, 100% intended for those who thought that inflation is settling gently back to target and that the Fed therefore can lower interest rates back to where we have a God-Given Right to have them, 2% or so.Not so fast! Median, by the way, was also a scintillating +0.53% m/m, the highest since last February. Thanks to base effects, the y/y Median CPI was essentially flat, at 4.90% y/y.Because of the deceleration in housing, I expect, I continue to see the Median slowing to the high-3s, and low-4s over the middle of this year.But it is going to have a hard time getting lower than that. In the short-term, we have a saucy performance from core services ex-shelter.In the short- and medium-term, core goods are going to get out of deflation (although I dont expect it to
rise
very far).And then housing should re-accelerate, though not back to the old highs. In short, inflation is a long way from being beaten.I am sure that somehow, thats bullish for stocks, but I cant figure out why. (I hear the 3-month moving average of the last four months of CPI, dropping the highest month, looks good.)"
Investing.com,Inflation Jitters Hits Wall Street; Fed Rate Cut Timeline Pushed Back,2024-02-14,0.333333,"Uh oh! Yesterdays inflation data from the US didnt go smoothly down the markets throat. Instead, the stronger-than-expected set of inflation data dashed hopes of seeing the Federal Reserve (Fed) cut rates anytime in the first half of this year.The
US 2-year yield
jumped past 4.60% and returned to the levels before the Feds pivot hint in December  when they had revealed a dot plot predicting 75bp cut this year. The
US 10-year
is back to 4.30%. There is no way the Fed cuts its rates in March. The probability of a May rate cut tanked from 56% to around 40% in a single session. Markets now see the first Fed cut happen in June, with around 75% chance. Thats such a wild ride in market expectations; we began this year pricing 80% chance for a March rate cut, and we came all the way to pricing a 75% chance for a June rate cut.No wonder, equities are not happy. The
S&P 500
fell 1.37% yesterday from an ATH and Nasdaq dived 1.58%. Small caps, which are more sensitive to financing costs, tanked almost 4%. Although some insist that the data could be just a blip in the US disinflation trend and should not get everyone panicked and selling, the overbought market conditions which resulted from overstretched rate cut expectations should find a more balanced place to sit. It would only be healthy for the S&P 500 and
Nasdaq
to consolidate and give back some of the latest advance. Otherwise, the valuations become excessive and unsustainable, anyway.Regarding the rate cuts, no one can tell you if June or July would be a better time for the Fed to start cutting. The data will decide when the time comes. Yet the incoming data shows a surprising strength in the US economy.
Atlanta Feds GDP estimate, for example, prints a 3.4% growth for Q1  far from a number that would push the Fed to start cutting rates. As such, the blip in yesterdays disinflation is more understandable than not given how strongly the US consumers spend.The
US Dollar Index
rallied past its 100-DMA and tested the 105 level on the back of exhausted Fed doves.
Gold
slipped below $2000 per ounce on the back of a stronger
dollar
and rising yields  that increase the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest-bearing gold. The
EUR/USD
tested 1.07 to the downside, and the
USD/JPY
rallied past the 150 level. All eyes are now shifting to the Japanese officials who could  anytime  intervene in the FX markets to cool down the selling pressure on the yen.For those who didnt have enough of inflation news, British inflation didnt rise as expected in January despite a stronger-than-expected jobs data released yesterday. Cable remains under pressure due to a softer-than-expected CPI read and a broadly stronger dollar, but the selloff in
EUR/GBP
has potential to extend toward the 0.84 level in the continuation of an ABCD bearish pattern.And finally, inflation in Switzerland got every single central banker envious as consumer prices in Switzerland rose only 1.3% in January on a yearly basis, down from 1.7% printed a month earlier. The super strong franc helped the Swiss keep their head above water this January  and even climb on a yacht! On a side note, I should admit that economists that put this number together have a better strategy for managing their health insurance costs (that went up by 10% this January on average) than I do, or the weight of insurance costs in the consumer basket doesnt match the reality. But the good news is, the below-target inflation should encourage the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to cut rates before the others, soften the
franc
, boost the Swiss economy & exports, and help the
SMI index
return to the top half of its 2022-to-now trading range. But the bad news is, appetite for SMI will still face a challenging blow to overall investor sentiment if things start getting ugly elsewhere."

Inveting.com,Bank Borrowing From Fed Bailout Program Has Surged,2024-01-05,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Is a U.S. banking crisis still bubbling under the surface?
If activity in the Federal Reserves bank bailout program is any indication,the answer to that question is yes.
Over the last two months,the balance in the Fed Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has surged,and the pace of borrowing appears to be increasing.
Since Nov. 19,the amount of outstanding loans in the BTFP has increased by $27.3 billion. The balance in the bailout program grew by nearly $5.4 billion in just the last week.
As of Jan. 3,the balance in the BTFP stood at just over $141.2 billion. Its the largest balance since the program was created in March.
Borrowing had leveled off in August before the sudden spike in November. Keep in mind that banks were still tapping into the bailout even as the total balance in the program plateaued. Some banks were paying off loans as others borrowed.
This surge in bank bailout borrowing may indicate more banks are struggling in this high interest rate environment,and that the financial crisis that kicked off in March is still bubbling under the surface.The BTFP program is a sweetheart deal for banks struggling to raise short-term capital.

 Inveting.com,National Debt Tops $34 Trillion but so What?,2024-01-04,0.333333,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
On Dec. 29,the national debt slipped above $34 trillion for the first time.
On the date,the debt was $34,001,493,655,565.48,to be exact.
But so what?Despite a few alarming headlines,nobody really seems to care. In fact,NPR did a story highlighting the supposed ""benefits"" of a massive national debt.
The debt continues to increase at a dizzying pace. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5,the national debt stood at $31.46 trillion. Since that time,the Biden administration has added $2.54 trillion to the national debt.
The government is running up the debt at roughly $1 trillion every three months. It eclipsed $32 trillion on June 15 and $33 trillion on September 15.
Since the beginning of 2016,the total debt has spiked by $15 trillion. Thats an 80 percent increase.
It's hard to wrap ones head around $34 trillion. To put things into perspective,every U.S. citizen would have to write a $101,234 check to pay off the debt. Every American taxpayer is on the hook for $264,090.
Or to look at it another way,$34 trillion is more than the total economies of China,Japan,Germany,and the UK combined.
Its a Spending Problem
The Biden administration likes to blame the ballooning debt on Republican tax cuts. But while federal receipts declined last year,they shrank from decade-high levels.
In fact,the government enjoyed a revenue windfall in 2022. According to a Tax Foundation analysis of Congressional Budget Office data,federal tax collections were up 21 percent that year. Tax collections also came in at a multi-decade high of 19.6 percent as a share of GDP. But at the time,CBO analysts warned the good times wouldnt last. And they didnt. Government receipts fell by 9.3 percent in fiscal 2023.
Falling revenues are certainly an issue,but you'll find the real problems on the spending side of the ledger.
On its way to the third-largest budget deficit in U.S. history,the Biden administration spent $6.46 trillion in fiscal 2023. That was an 8.8 percent year-over-year increase in actual spending.
You might think Congress solved this problem with the spending cuts in the debt ceiling deal (aka the [misnamed]
Fiscal Responsibility Act
). But we live in an upside-down world where spending cuts mean spending still goes up.
Even if Congress and the president managed to stick to the plan (and they wont),the so-called spending cuts will not put a dent in actual total spending. That means we can expect massive deficits to continue month after month.
This isnt to let Republicans off the hook. Despite occasionally paying lip service to fiscal responsibility,the GOP also borrows,spends,and runs big budget shortfalls.
To put the deficits into some historical perspective,before the pandemic,the U.S. government had only run budget deficits of over $1 trillion four times  all by the Obama administration in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.The Trump administration almost hit the $1 trillion mark in 2019 and was on pace to run a trillion-dollar deficit in fiscal 2020 prior to the pandemic,even as the U.S. supposedly enjoyed the best economy ever. The economic catastrophe caused by the governments response to COVID-19 gave policymakers an excuse to spend with no questions asked and we saw record deficits in fiscal 2020 and 2021.
Now the Biden administration has settled into the new status quo  running 08 financial crisis-like deficits every single year.
Notably,this relentless increase in debt is happening when the economy is supposedly strong. Typically,a strong
economy
generates more tax revenue,and deficits shrink. But this isnt really a strong economy. It is a house of cards built on debt. Fiscal stimulus is helping to prop it up.So What?
One of the most common responses I get when I talk about the national debt is,So what?
After all,the national debt has been expanding precipitously for years. Nothing has happened.
At least not yet.
But this is clearly an unsustainable trajectory.
This rapid increase in the national debt is happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills.
Interest expense rose by 23 percent to $879 billion in fiscal 2023. Net interest,excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds,rose by 39 percent to $659 billion. Both of those numbers broke records.Looking at Novembers interest expense puts things into a little sharper perspective.
Uncle Sam spent $79.92 billion in interest expense to finance the national debt in November. That was more than national defense ($70 billion) and more than Medicare ($79 billion). The only higher spending category was Social Security.
A lot of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month,some of that super-low-interest paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates.
The weighted average interest rate on the governments $26 trillion of outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.10 percent in November. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.22 percent in November 2022.Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words,the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
The bottom line is interest payments will continue to quickly climb much higher unless rates fall.
This may be one of the reasons the Federal Reserve is so eager to cut interest rates in 2024 despite price inflation being nowhere near the 2 percent target.
If the national debt climbs to $40 trillion and interest rates remain at 5 percent,interest payments on the debt would skyrocket around $2 trillion per year. That means that even if the U.S. government balanced the budget so receipts covered all spending minus interest payments,wed still be facing a $2 trillion annual deficit.
Of course,there wont be a balanced budget. So,lets assume the federal government can maintain the current deficit level of around $1 trillion annually (minus interest expense). Even with this overly optimistic scenario,the Treasury would be running a $3 trillion annual budget deficit. (Thats the current $1 trillion deficit plus $2 trillion in interest expenses.)
And the most likely scenario is spending will continue to climb,along with the budget deficits. Theres no telling how high the annual deficits could run.This is a fiscal powder keg. All it needs is a match.

 Inveting.com,US Dollar Recovers as 2024 Kicks Off,2024-01-03,0.666667,"As we kick off January,it's common to witness some fluctuations in the stock market,primarily driven by portfolio adjustments and profit-taking activities. Many investors and fund managers engage in realigning their portfolios at the start of the year,often opting to realize profits from the previous year. This strategy is typically aimed at deferring tax liabilities,as these gains will be taxed in the new tax year,rather than in 2023.Concurrently,we might observe a rally in the US dollar. This trend is partly influenced by these portfolio adjustments,as investors may temporarily shift towards cash or dollar-denominated assets during this period of rebalancing.
However,it's important to note that these movements are often temporary.The market is likely to stabilize or even reverse these early trends as the month progresses and investment flows normalize. Additionally,today's release of the Federal Reserve minutes will offer more insights into the central bank's latest meetings.

 Inveting.com,What Would It Take to Get a Depression?,2023-12-27,0.222222,"By Peter St. Onge,PhD
So far this year,my base case on the economy has been that we're repeating the 1970's stagflation. With a first bout of high inflation followed by a period of rapid GDP growth that ends in a second,even worse,stagflation.
Going by the 70s,that second stagflation could go on for a long time considering the last one was only ended by a brutal series of engineered recessions that cost Jimmy Carter his job.
In other words,Washington won't make that mistake again  next time they'll just let it run.
All pretty dire,but there's actually another shoe to drop an even worse outcome that  going by commenters  a lot of people are worried about"

I think that as long as jobs data and inflation figures will not show the same picture for the economy,thats how long market can be a bit tricky and choppy on dollar pairs.

 Inveting.com,Stocks Week Ahead,2024-01-08,0.666667,"This week will be another in-focus week,with the
CPI
and
PPI
reports coming toward the weeks end.Additionally,3 Treasury auctions will be front and center as well. This will follow a fairly previous strong week of data,which suggests the US economy is hanging in nicely.Currently,Bloomberg Economics
GDP
Nowcast is forecasting fourth-quarter growth of around 2.3%,which is slower than the roughly 5% third-quarter print but still a respectable growth rate.Coupled with a roughly 3%
inflation
rate,nominal growth is still around 5ish %. Again,it is a health level.Given a 5% nominal growth rate,I think it will be tough to see the Fed cut rates at the moment as aggressively as the market has priced in.As of the third quarter,Nominal GDP y/y growth was still above the Fed Funds rate,and even with a 5% nominal growth in the fourth,the Fed Funds rate and nominal growth would be almost equal.It isnt until the Fed funds rate is 0.5% to 1% higher than nominal growth that downward pressure is exerted on the economy,and the odds for recession seem to increase.So I think,at the bare minimum,the Fed can continue to be patient and see what the data says,and the CPI report this week may or may not help that cause.The median expectation is for an increase of 3.2% in December,while inflation swaps are priced at an increase of 3.32%.If we look back at the data over the last few months when rounding to the nearest 0.1%,swaps have only overestimated CPI 1 time out of the last six times.At the same time,the median has overestimated the actual CPI 3 times.So,if we care about when the CPI has come in hotter than expected,the inflation swaps have had a better run,so one should be mindful of the risk that CPI comes in above the consensus of 3.2% this month.If the swap data turns out to be right,given where GDP growth in nominal terms appears to be,the odds of the Fed cutting rates as aggressively as the market has priced will likely not be supported by the data.Fed Funds policy will need to be held in place for some time longer.The Fed sees rates around 4.65% at the end of 2024,while swaps are trading at 3.78% and Fed Fund Futures are trading at 3.94%. The gap is too wide and will need to be closed.This will likely result in rates across the curve rising further because assuming a 2% inflation rate,with the 5-year trading at 4%,suggests a Fed funds rate of 2%,lower than the Feds longer-run rate of 2.5%.So it would probably suggest a 50 bps upside to the 5-year from current levels and the entire curve.While it doesnt suggest a
10-year
rate moving back to the October higher,it does suggest a 10-year rate perhaps moving back to 4.5 to 4.6%.Given that the 10-year is showing positive and strong momentum from a break out in the relative strength index and a strong break out from a downtrend on the price chart,it wont take much,perhaps more than a close above the 200-day moving average,to get the 10-year moving higher towards 4.25% to 4.3%.Inflation data may only add to the breakout that already appears to be taking place.The
dollar
would also likely get a boost. While the dollar isnt as well positioned as the 10-year currently,It is getting closer to seeing a significant breakout,with an RSI trending higher overall and breaking free in several key spots.If the
DXY
can clear the 102.65 region,it has room to run to around 103.50 and test horizontal resistance and the 200-day moving average.The
S&P 500
is also on its way lower and has recently fallen below its 10-day exponential and 20-day simple moving averages,with the lower Bollinger band around 4,580 being one potential target.Of course,it is not uncommon that when an index hits the upper Bollinger Band,it retraces to the lower Bollinger band over time,and in that case,that would be around 4,100 on the weekly chart.It isnt uncommon on the monthly chart,meaning a revisit to the lows of around 3,600. Because that is what happened in mid-2022,early 2020,late 2018,and in parts of 2016.The December 2023 rally pushed the index above the upper Bollinger band. We are now in 2024,of course. Have you noticed the trend?The market has been very aggressive with rate cuts,and rate cuts to the degree the market has priced doesnt look rightalso,the earnings multiple of the S&P 500 is too high at 19.4.The median PE ratio for a 12-month forward S&P 500 is 16.4; at roughly $242 in earnings per share,the value of the S&P 500 would be around 3,960.That is,assuming that earnings grow by 10%,should they grow by just 5%,and are instead $231 per share,the value drops to 3,790.So,from a fundamental and technical basis,a drop back towards the lower monthly Bollinger band should not be completely ruled out or viewed as fiction.The fundamentals and technical aspects suggest it be possible,especially if rates increase again and earnings dont live up to the hype.Enjoy the final week of Football.

 Inveting.com,Key Data Could Spring Surprises in the First Week of New Year,2024-01-02,0.555556,"The first week of 2024 will be a big one,with a lot of data that will either justify the market rally and expectations for rate cuts or not.Data that comes in too hot will kill the idea of rate cuts starting as soon as March,and data that comes in too cold will kill the idea of a soft landing. It means Goldilocks must return from her Christmas trip to Aruba and appear this week.For December,the
ISM manufacturing
index is expected to rise to 47.1 from 46.7,while the service index falls to 52.5 from 52.7.
ADP
is expected to show 113,000 new jobs were created in December versus 103,000 in November.Finally,the official BLS job report
predicts
163,000 new jobs will have been made,down from 199,000 in November.Overall,these numbers are consistent with their prior trends and suggest no significant change in economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model indicates that the fourth quarter is growing by a 2.4% seasonally adjusted annualized rate.At least,based on the estimates,there doesnt seem to be enough to support rate cuts any time shortly. If it comes in as expected,I think that data is probably enough to turn higher the recent decline in rates and tighten financial conditions.By most standards,financial conditions have eased so much that the easing could have already substituted for rate cuts.In fact,over the last two months,the GS financial conditions index has reduced by its most ever. One could argue this could have a stimulative effect on the US economy as we move forward.On top of this,we have started to see shipping rates rising,as noted by the WCI Composite Container Freight Benchmark,which has increased from 1381 on November 30 to 1660 on December 21.It will be interesting to see if the recent increase in freight cost shows up in the ISM manufacturing Priced Paid PMI for December.There are no estimates currently,but the index was 49.9 in November. If one thing is clear,higher freight costs and easing financial conditions lead to higher prices over time.If this shows up,then I would think the recent decline in long-term rates will likely reverse; how high rates on the back of the curve go from here is unclear,but there are signs that the
10-year rate
can also go higher from a technical standpoint.The RSI is starting to consolidate and is even showing signs of turning higher. The big test will be when the 10-year reaches the 10-day exponential moving average and if it can breathe above that moving average.If the 10-year does break higher,the downtrend at 4% becomes the next target,and after that,we would be talking about a 10-year moving higher to around 4.35%.Overall,I think this will likely result in the
10/2
curve moving higher,with most of the heavy lifting coming from the back of the curve. It certainly appears like the curve is breaking out of a downtrend.As for the
S&P 500
,higher rates and steeper curves will present problems,especially if it is because we begin to start seeing the effects of easing financial conditions in this weeks data points.The S&P 500 also broke below a rising wedge pattern and is closing in on the 10-day exponential moving average,which hasnt been broken since November 2.That moving average comes at 4,745 and is around the zero gamma level.The zero gamma level is the line that separates positive from negative gamma; a break below the zero gamma level would push the index back into negative gamma and increase volatility. I still think a return to 4,100 over the next several weeks is likely.So,at this point,it seems a lot is riding on the data this week,and to keep the market moving higher,it will take the data coming in just right. Anything too hot or cold will be a big blow to the end-of-year rally.Original Post"

the rise in stock prices typically seen in January

Dow Jones Industrial Average
to evaluate how reliable it isand whether traders should trust it moving forward.There are multiple compelling explanations for a general rally in stocks in the first month of a new year.The practice of
tax-loss harvesting
where investors sell losing stocks in December to offset capital gains tax,followed by a rebound in buying during Januaryhas been a significant factor. Add to this the injection of
year-end bonuses and new investment resolutions
,and you have a potent mix fueling early-year market activity. Moreover,the
strategic 'window dressing'
by mutual fund managers,aiming to polish their portfolios by year-end,might also amplify January's performance figures.These factors suggest that January's market behavior is a composite of calculated financial moves and investor psychology.First things first

 Inveting.com,Reconsidering the Dovish Fed Expectations,2024-01-08,0.555556,"The New Year unsurprisingly kicked off with a hangover for both stock and bond markets,as investors began the year by closing their positions and taking profit following an impressive two-month rally that was boosted by the expectation that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would soon start cutting the interest rates and cut them thoroughly throughout this year. We begin the new year with the expectation that the Fed will cut the rates 5 times,by 25bp each,and the first rate cut will be announced by March,with around 64% probability. Note that this probability was standing somewhere around 80% by the end of last year and its come down,as investors probably realized that the expectations and the market rally went well ahead of themselves. And of course,the minutes from the Feds last meeting,released last week,didnt give any clarity other than the general thinking that the Fed rates are certainly at or near their peak for this cycle,but that there is an unusually elevated degree of uncertainty meaning that the expectation of around 75bp cut this year is certainly not a done deal. And indeed,the strength of the US economy and its jobs market wouldnt justify an imminent start of the Fed cuts this spring.In this context,last weeks jobs data from the US came in stronger than expected,yet again. The US economy added more than 200000 new nonfarm jobs in December,and the average earnings accelerated more than expected,above 4%. Some saw a bit of weakness in the US job metrics pointing at the falling job openings and the falling participation rate,but rationally speaking,an NFP figure above 200K is not pointing at a severe slowdown which would urge the Fed to start cutting the rates in two-and-something month and cut by 150bp to the end of the year. Even Janet Yellen said it  in quite an unusual declaration after Fridays jobs report said that what we are seeing now I think we can describe as soft landing,and again a soft landing doesnt justify a 150bp cut from the Fed this year.As such,there is no surprise that we see the
US 2-year
yield rebound to 4.40% and the 10-year yield return past the 4% - its biggest weekly advance of the
US 10-year
yield since October. The rising yields halted the
dollar
s bleeding. The
EUR/USD
sank below the 1.10 mark as soon as the year started. The rising US yields also stopped the rally in equities. The
S&P 500
dipped below 4700  having been unable to post a fresh record at the end of the latest rally,and the rate-sensitive
Nasdaq 100
fell more than 4% since its December peak  which was an ATH. And because the correlation between the US treasuries and Nasdaq 100 stocks remains high,a further rise in the US yields will likely cause a deeper retreat for the US stocks  and especially the most-loved tech stocks. But note that this correlation will likely decline with the start of the earnings season this week,as the company results will give investors a various range of reasons to buy or sell stocks. Overall,according to FactSet,the estimated yoy earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 1.3% for the Q4. If thats the case,it will mark the second straight quarter of year-over-year earnings growth for the index,and its another evidence that the US economy doesnt need the Feds help to stay afloat.This weeks major economic data is the US inflation data due Thursday. The headline inflation in the US is expected to have slowly accelerated to 3.2% from 3.1% printed a month earlier,while core inflation is expected to have further eased to 3.8% from 4% printed a month earlier. Soft inflation numbers,ideally softer-than-expected,could slow the corrective selloff in both stock and bond markets,yet the inflation risks are now tilted to the upside. Tensions in the Red Sea region explode the price of shipping goods from Asia to Europe and America. The cost of shipping goods from Asia to Europe doubled since last December,and thats a bad indication of whats to come for inflation numbers in the coming months. Remember,the last time we saw the shipping costs surge  that was during the pandemic  had followed a significant rise in a very wide range of consumer prices. Therefore yes,inflation figures in US and Europe have come significantly down last year,but the easing could slow or reverse. And thats the biggest risk to the dovish Fed and European Central Bank (ECB),and Bank of England (BoE) expectations this year.Happily,though,the oil prices continue to see strong resistance despite the Red Sea tensions. The barrel of
US crude
couldnt clear the $74 offers last week and we start the week below the $73pb level. The geopolitical risks prevail,but traders continue to see the tops in an effort to force the price of a barrel of American crude to below $70pb again."

 Inveting.com,Did Markets Get Ahead of Themselves? December Surge Faces Reality Check in January,2024-01-08,0.666667,"Markets rose last month,continuing Novembers rally as interest rates pulled back even more on expectations of Fed rate cuts in 2024. Markets in the U.S. were up by mid-single digits,finishing a solid quarter and a very strong year. International markets were also up substantially for the month,quarter,and year. And while stocks were hot,even fixed income posted enough gains to close out the year in the black. 2023 ended with a bang.Interest rates. The rally was,once again,due mainly to interest rates,which kept dropping in December. Better inflation numbers raised hopes the Fed would start cutting rates this year,and signs of slower but continued economic growth supported that idea.Between job growth moving closer to pre-pandemic levels,healthy consumer confidence and spending,and continued weakness in manufacturing,the economy seemed to be settling into a soft landing,which could keep pulling inflation downward. In response,the
10-year
U.S. Treasury yield dropped back to levels last seen in August,driving markets higher.Changing expectations. Looking forward,we may see a change in expectations in the new year. Markets have been choppy so far this month,and there is commentary suggesting that they may have gotten ahead of themselves.After a strong year-end,the seasonal factors can be less positive at the start of the year,which could be a headwind. In addition,the Fed may start pushing back on rate cut expectations,which would be another negative. Overall,in my view,conditions should remain positive in January,but perhaps somewhat less so than last month.Current risks. While overall conditions remain positive,there are still risks. The Fed is concerned that inflation may return in some sectors,which must be watched for its effect on rates.The ongoing war in the Middle East shows signs of expanding and affecting trade routes and supply lines. And domestic politics remain a concern as the election gets closer. But with the fundamentals reasonably healthy and the macro picture stabilizing,many of the economic fears that pulled markets back last year may subside.The markets and inflation. As we start the year,the key issues will be whether growth continues at a slower rate and inflation moves downward. Market expectations on rates have changed rapidly. If the Fed continues to act in a dovish manner,that positive reaction could continue. That said,there is a mismatch between what the market expects (six or more rate cuts) and what the Fed says (only three rate cuts).That mismatch in the past has given rise to volatility,so this is a risk to watch,even if conditions otherwise remain favorable.That is the bottom line herewhile conditions are good,volatility looks likely. The last two months were great for markets as rates pulled back,but conditions could change. Looking forward to the new year,we are still not out of the woods with inflation or growth. And while the trends remain positive,risks may pick up again over the next couple of months.As of this mornings jobs report,job growth is still healthy. The things to watch going forward will be consumer confidence and consumer spending. If they remain at pre-pandemic levels,then a soft landing looks increasingly likely,and the Fed should continue to send dovish signals. If not,we could see more volatility.Even in the case of volatility,the solid fundamentals should limit the damage and help set us up for more growth later this year. I believe this is something to watch for,but not to worry about too much."
 Inveting.com,What Is in Store for 2024,2024-01-05,0.666667,"This year promises to be one of the most interesting years economically,politically,and market-wise in history. We have two significant global conflicts/wars ongoing,just as President Xi of China is reiterating his promise to annex Taiwan,and Kim Jong Un of North Korea threatens to wipe the US off the map. Meanwhile,we have the most likely Republican candidate getting thrown off state ballots under the disgusting guise of trying to preserve democracy. The US is sadly in the process of becoming a banana republic. Wars and revolutions are not a tail risk. They are happening now and are likely to metastasize in 2024.With this backdrop,we have the most expensive stock market in history prior to 2020. The price-to-sales ratio is 2.62,and the total market cap of equities is 176% of GDP; both figures are near record highs and dwarf the historical averages prior to the pandemic. And the equity risk premium is zero. Meaning the earnings yield of stocks is less than that yield offered by simply owning a risk-free T-bill. In other words,investors are not getting compensated at all for the extra risk of owning stocks over bonds.We think earnings growth this year will be in the low single digits at best. However,Wall Street gurus have penned in
S&P 500
EPS growth of nearly 12% this year. But even if that growth is somehow incredibly achieved,the market has already priced in that hope. The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.3. This P/E ratio is above the 5-year average of 18.8 and above the 10-year average 17.6,according to FactSet.Therefore,economic growth must absolutely soar in 2024 to justify these valuation metrics. Or,the Fed must slash borrowing costs back towards ZIRP. But the latter scenario would only occur if the Fed was reacting to an economy that was falling apart,which cannot be good news for stocks. Yet,even in the former scenario,the Fed would not be cutting rates at all. Nevertheless,there are 3 rate cuts indicated by the Feds dot plot,and the 6 cuts are being priced in by the futures market. Therefore,even in the highly unlikely scenario of exploding GDP this year,it would probably entail rising rates instead of rate cuts,which would still provide a headwind for stocks.The overhanging problem is that the Treasury must find a buyer for $7 trillion of government debt this year alone. $5 trillion must be rolled over,and $2 trillion will be needed to fund the annual deficit. This will put tremendous pressure on the bond market no matter what.The month of March will be key time for markets. The reverse repo facility should get run down in at the end of the Q1 or the start of Q2. That easy liquidity for the already illiquid bond market will disappear. March is also the month when the BTFP is scheduled to expire. This entails the process of the Fed selling $133 billion in Treasuries and MBS that are sharply underwater back to the banks; and in exchange,the banks pay 100 cents on the dollar to the Fed,plus interest. Powell needs to end this program to stop the rampant speculation on Wall Street and to ensure inflation retreats towards the 2% target. But doing so will wreak havoc on the regional banking system. His decision on this front will be critical.The recession penciled in for last year did not materialize because of the massive fiscal spending and the bailout of the entire regional banking system; a.k.a. BTFP. However,the conditions for engendering a recession have not been resolved,they have been exacerbatedregardless of the soft-landing mantra prevalent in the MSFM. They are screaming goldilocks while in reality,the economy is more fragile today than ever.This does not guarantee a recession; but it does virtually guarantee that a booming economy is not in the bag. And that means investors should not blindly own the S&P 500 and trust in a bull market that never ends.I very well understand that the Fed and Treasury will indeed seek to bailout every hiccup in the market and the economy. However,this is old news. The government rode to the rescue in the tech bubble recession at the turn of the millennia and during the global financial crisis and real estate crash of 2008. But neither ZIRP,or QE,or TARP,or any of the alphabet soup of bailout programs served to stop the 50% + debacle in markets.These inflationary bailouts do tend to paper over the issues eventually; but not immediately. And of course,they result in more problems that turn out to be much more dire and intractable in the long run. In the vanguard of these problems is another round of asset bubbles,even more debt being incurred,and the condition of out-of-control inflation,which further eviscerates the middle class.In sharp contrast to recent history,if the Fed and Treasury were to try and truncate the recession,debt default,and reconciliation of asset prices,by another round of money printing and spending this time around,they will be doing so with the sting of record-high inflation fresh in the minds of consumers and businesses and investors. Therefore,the confidence in the worlds reserve status of USD and the US bond market could be obliterated. Meaning,what we could very well see is a condition where the economy enters a recession but long-term bond yields go up instead of down as is usually the case. Such an unprecedented and dangerous combination of higher borrowing costs in a faltering economy would result in carnage for stock valuations.Financial conditions and credit spreads remain quiescent for now. Therefore,we remain net long in our Inflation/Deflation and Economic Cycle Model. But we remain ready to sprint for the narrow exit door once the sell signal is received.My prediction and admonishment for 2024,be prepared for everything.**Michael Pento is the President and Founder of

 Inveting.com,The Only 2 Ways to Win in Trading,2023-09-19,0.666667,"It doesnt matter if you are Warren Buffett holding positions for decades or Ken Griffith holding them for milliseconds - there are only two ways to trade.In trading you can either go with the price action - or in traders parlance trade flow or go against the price action or fade the move.If you are going to day trade against trend need to know three things - what to trade,when to trade and how much profit to go for.Here is a set up I trade every day in stock index futures. During the European open (around 4 am) stock futures usually make a session high or session low that is fadable for at least 20 points. And even if the trade doesnt work the first time it usually resolves in profit on the second or the third attempt.But trend! Trend is something different altogether. Trend or flow trading has a very specific tell that can give very accurate reads on the market.Here is my proprietary bounce indicator in Flow mode. Notice anything? Flow trades which are bright green tiles on the chart tend to bunch together. Once a flow trade takes shape it tends to be followed by another.So what does that mean to us as retail traders?Simple. We only take a flow trade if the prior trade hit the take profit. If the prior trade was a loss we STOP TRADING until flow turn profitable again. Using this stop and go method we avoid the dreaded churn and increase our chance of winning trades tremendously.So here is the surprising takeaway for day trading. To trade counter trend you need to keep trying until you find the turn in the price action. But to trade trend you need stop and go stop and go until you sync yourself up with the trend move in the market.Thats pretty much the opposite of what most traders do - but now you know!"

Boeing 737 Max Blowout Points to Pervasive FlawsSaudi Aramco cut the official selling price for its flagship Arab Light crude to a $1.50-a-barrel premium to the regional benchmark for February,the lowest since November 2021. The $2-a-barrel reduction was deeper than foreseen,and follows a weakening of spot differentials for Middle Eastern crudes due to lackluster Chinese appetite and increased global supplies.Oil capped the first annual loss since 2020 last year as non-OPEC+ production expanded,and traders looked ahead to slower growth in demand,including from key importer China. Crudes weakness has prompted Riyadh to make a deep voluntary output cut,as well as complementary reductions from other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.Saudi pricing has been lowered in line with the spot market,which may potentially boost margins for customers that use the kingdoms cargoes as their baseload,refiners and traders said. Aramcos pricing is typically followed by other major producers in the Middle East such as Kuwait and Iraq.Still,at least three Asian customers said the price drop was unlikely to lead to requests for incremental deliveries from the Saudis as there are cheaper,rival supplies still available in the spot market. Two Chinese buyers said they wont be lifting any term cargoes from the Saudis for next month.Last month,Chinese refiners said they would receive less Saudi crude on-month for January loading. Asian crude buyers were also seen turning elsewhere after the kingdom reduced pricing of its key grade by only half the amount forecast.--With assistance from Sarah Chen.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Americas Car Buyers Are Rethinking EVs

The two parties reached a settlement on the eve of the trial,one of Haslams representatives confirmed.Although details of the settlement havent yet been made public,the deal is likely to clear the way for Buffett to purchase the remaining 20% of Pilot Travel from Haslam later this month under terms of the original acquisition. The accord means both sides will dismiss all claims against each other,according to Haslams spokesperson.A docket filing in Delaware Chancery Court said the trial,scheduled for Monday in Wilmington before Judge Morgan Zurn,had been cancelled. A lawyer for Buffett didnt immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Haslam,the owner of the NFLs Cleveland Browns,was expected to testify live in the trial,but Buffett was not.The settlement resolves a case that set up a bitter legal battle between the two billionaires. Haslam contends Pilot Travel executives installed by Buffett changed quarterly-earning accounting methods in a way that will cut the value of his holdings by $1.2 billion if the Tennessee-based billionaire choses to sell Buffett his remaining stake.Read More"

Boeing CEOs Comeback Plan for 2024 Takes a Hit Five Days InWould-be Bitcoin ETF issuers have been given until Monday morning in Washington to submit any last-minute revisions to their pending applications,Bloomberg News has reported. The US Securities and Exchange Commission itself has until Jan. 10 to take action on at least one of those applications,and crypto insiders have speculated the regulator will use that date to announce a slew of decisions at once.There are two technical requirements that must be fulfilled before a spot-backed Bitcoin ETF can start trading. First,the SEC must sign off on so-called 19b-4 filings by the exchanges that would list the ETFs. Second,the regulator must approve the relevant S-1 forms,which are the registration applications from the would-be issuers  a list that includes BlackRock and Fidelity.The SEC is planning to vote on the exchanges filings,the 19b-4s,in the coming days,Bloomberg News has reported. The regulator may or may not then take action on the issuers applications,the S-1s,around the same time. If the SEC grants both sets of required approvals,the ETFs could start trading as soon as the next business day.An SEC representative declined to comment on the status of the applications.ETF ImpactBitcoins boosters say ETFs backed by the largest crypto token would represent a watershed moment for digital assets. Billions of dollars are at stake,representing potential inflows from retail and institutional investors alike.The market is still seriously underestimating the potential impact of a Bitcoin ETF approval,said Michael Anderson,co-founder of crypto venture firm Framework Ventures.Story continuesBut the SEC under the Democrat Gary Gensler and his Trump-era predecessor Jay Clayton has previously refused to allow such a product to launch,citing concerns about investor protection and the potential for market manipulation.However,speculation has been mounting since August,when the SEC lost a key legal fight against crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments,that the regulator will have to acquiesce to the growing clamor for the product.Market wagers that regulatory approval is on the horizon fueled a jump of approximately 160% in Bitcoin last year. That still wasnt enough to re-attain the record highs set in November 2021,when Bitcoin hit almost $69,000.The token has stayed in a relatively tight range around $44,000 since the start of 2024.

Boeing 737 Max Blowout Points to Pervasive FlawsThe dynamic was on display Friday,when bond prices dipped after the Labor Department reported that job growth unexpectedly accelerated last month. But the selloff was curtailed because buyers swooped in as 10-year Treasury yields neared 4.1%,the highest since mid-December.The rebound  even in the face of data showing continued strength in the economy  highlighted the stark shift in sentiment over the past two months,with investors increasingly confident that the bond market is firmly recovering from its worst downturn in decades. Despite the recent backup,yields are still well below Octobers peaks as traders wager that the Fed may start easing monetary policy as soon as March.Anything between 4% and 4.2% is a buy for the 10-year,said Priya Misra,portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management,noting that the yield was at the upper end of that range ahead of the last Fed meeting. For 4.2% to break,we have to bring hikes back in or take out overall cuts.The rally that gripped the bond market during the last two months of 2023 put an end to what had been the worst losses in decades,driving Treasuries to a gain for the year and bolstering conviction that yields wont retest the previous peaks. While investors are mindful that yields may drift higher if incoming data alters expectations about the Feds likely path,some big investment firms have been looking at recent drops as good times to buy.Australian and New Zealand yields moved higher on Monday,though the moves were in line with those seen for Treasuries on Friday. The yield on Australian 10-year notes added four basis points to 4.17%,after similar-dated US rates climbed five basis points to 4.05% at the end of last week. New Zealand 10-year yields rose six basis points to 4.61%. Cash Treasuries are shut in Asian hours Monday because Japan is on holiday.Story continuesStrategists at TD Securities told clients Friday that while bonds could still slide further in the near-term they remained convinced the labor market is cooling and the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2024 at 3%.The bond market is not ready to give up on their optimistic assessment for Fed rate cuts this year,said Kevin Flanagan,head of fixed-income strategy at WisdomTree. A narrative of buying on the dips will remain,and it will take more than one jobs report to change that.Not all segments of the bond market are seen as sheltered from losses,with policy-sensitive two-year bonds potentially at risk to repricing if traders dial back rate-cut bets further due to the strength of the economy. And the market is facing further tests this week,with the release of the December consumer-price index reading and a $37 billion 10-year Treasury auction that will provide a key gauge of demand. Theres also focus on a public appearance by New York Fed President John Williams,who has been among officials recently pushing back on market expectations for steep rate reductions early this year.But the Fed has held policy steady since July,and the December meeting minutes released Wednesday showed that policymakers anticipated that they would likely begin easing this year.Read More"
Yahoo Finance ,Analysis-Unloved healthcare stocks draw investors despite US election risks,2024-01-08,0.555556,"By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. healthcare sector is showing signs of life after lagging in 2023 as investors bet cheap valuations will offset a tendency to underperform during presidential election years.The S&P 500 healthcare sector has climbed about 6% since the start of December,doubling the gain of the broader index during that period. Its performance during 2023 overall was far less impressive,as it rose just 0.3% compared to the S&P 500s 24% jump.Healthcare,which has a roughly 13% weight in the S&P 500,was one of the areas left behind last year as investors flocked to the narrow group of massive tech and growth stocks that propelled indexes higher.The rise of new obesity treatments sparked worries that there would be less need for medical treatments aimed at weight-related health conditions at the same time demand for COVID-19 products waned.The sector's lackluster showing has made it an attractive target for investors looking for undervalued areas of the market. The healthcare sector trades at 17.9 times forward earnings estimates versus a P/E ratio of 19.7 for the S&P 500,a discount of 9%. Historically,healthcare has traded at a 4% premium to the broader index,data from LSEG Datastream showed.Investors are starting to look out for those sectors that didnt work in 2023,and healthcare fits that bill,said Art Hogan,chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth,who is recommending investors ""overweight"" the healthcare sector.Some investors are also betting that the rally that boosted tech and growth stocks will spread to other areas - a phenomenon that appears to have started late last year as banks,small caps and other unloved areas of the market drew heavy buying.Earnings are another potential bright spot,with companies in healthcare expected to increase profits by 17.5% in 2024,versus an 11.1% rise for the S&P 500 overall,according to LSEG data.Last year was a very narrow market and I think that broadens out in 2024 and creates opportunities for lots of different stocks to perform better,including healthcare stocks,said Michael Smith,senior portfolio manager for Allspring Global's Discovery Large Cap Growth Fund,which owns shares of UnitedHealth Group,Intuitive Surgical and Veeva Systems.Story continuesThe discount is more acute in certain areas of healthcare.Excluding Eli Lilly,whose shares soared last year on enthusiasm over the potential of its weight-loss treatment,a group of large-cap drugmakers and biotech companies tracked by JPMorgan were trading at a 30% discount to the S&P 500,a ""historically low"" level,the bank's analysts said in a note late last month.Patrick Kaser,a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global,said the firm's value-stock funds are significantly overweight the sector,including holdings in CVS Health,Bristol Myers Squibb and Viatris.Classically,value investors are looking for a group that is out of favor with low valuations,"" Kaser said. ""Healthcare checks both those boxes really well right now.REASONS FOR CAUTIONAn early test for the sector comes at this week's JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco,where investors are gathering to hear dozens of companies forecast the year ahead and talk about their prospects.There are reasons for caution regarding healthcares performance in 2024.The widely expected scenario of a stable but slowing economy,ebbing inflation and falling interest rates could give investors little reason to abandon the big tech and growth stocks that worked for them last year. Those same factors could also be more favorable to sectors that are more tightly linked to the economy,such as financials and industrials.Healthcare stocks also tend to struggle in presidential election years,as the cost of medical care frequently emerges as a political issue that puts the industry in the crosshairs. The sector has only beaten the S&P 500 in three of the past 12 presidential election years,according to Strategas.However,some investors believe this year's presidential contest poses less risk to healthcare stocks than recent past elections.Neither political party is expected to gain significant majorities in Congress,diminishing the chances of major legislation that overhauls the industry,while President Joe Biden already enacted legislation during his first term that addresses drug prices.Generally,healthcare is ""an easy target for politicians,"" said Kaser.This year,""I dont think there is a likely outcome of anything big and new hitting the sector... (There is) less uncertainty than many election years.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Bill Berkrot)"

Yahoo Finance ," Court cancels Warren Buffett,Jimmy Haslam trial over Pilot",2024-01-07,0.333333,"By Tom HalsWILMINGTON,Delaware (Reuters) - An unusual,billion-dollar trial between Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and the billionaire Haslam family was canceled by the court on Saturday,two days before it was scheduled to start.""This confirms that the trial scheduled in this matter for January 8 and 9,2024 is hereby canceled and has been removed from the Court's calendar,"" said a Saturday docket entry for the case. The entry said it was authorized by Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn,the judge.The Haslam family,Berkshire Hathaway and the chambers for Zurn could not be reached for comment.The two-day non-jury trial in Delaware's Court of Chancery was meant to determine the value of the Haslam family's 20% stake in Pilot Travel Centers,the largest U.S. truck stop chain.It was expected to feature testimony from Buffett's designated successor,Greg Abel.The Haslams,including Cleveland Browns football team owner Jimmy Haslam,sold Berkshire 80% of Pilot for $11 billion in two separate deals,in 2017 and January 2023.They also have a put option,allowing them to sell the remaining 20% in the first two months of any year.Pilot,which also operates under the Flying J brand,has about 650 locations and sold 13 billion gallons of fuel in 2022.Each side has accused the other of accounting tricks to manipulate the Knoxville,Tennessee-based company's earnings before interest and taxes,or EBIT,which determines the value of the Haslam's 20% stake.According to the Haslams,after Berkshire obtained the 80% Pilot stake it adopted ""pushdown accounting"" that would reduce how much it would owe if the put option were exercised.A lawyer for Berkshire said in court that depending on which side's accounting was used,EBIT would differ by $1.2 billion.The trial outcome would have turned on a simple question"

I think that as long as jobs data and inflation figures will not show the same picture for the economy, thats how long market can be a bit tricky and choppy on dollar pairs. From an Elliott wave perspective, I see DXY in a corrective a-b-c rally, back in wave four that can be moving into 104.50-105 resistance so technically trend is down, but we need some catalyst for the downtrend to resume.

Investing.com,Gold Price Fluctuates on Mixed Economic Data; USD/JPY Weakens on Strong US Dollar,2024-01-08,0.666667,"On Friday, the gold (XAU) price experienced extra volatility after the US Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) and ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) were released.XAU/USD
dropped towards 2,025 after the release of higher-than-expected NFP figures. However, the pair rose after ISM Services PMI numbers appeared lower than the forecast, reaching 2,064. Friday's data revealed that 216,000 new jobs were added in December, exceeding the forecast of 170,000. Thus, the data indicates the labor market's robustness even under tight financial conditions. Meanwhile, the PMI report indicated a significant slowdown in US service activity in December. According to the CME FedWatch tool, markets now estimate roughly a 64% chance of a rate cut by the US central bank in March, decreasing from 90% before the New Year.XAU/USD declined during the Asian and early European sessions. Today, the macroeconomic calendar is rather uneventful. 'Spot gold may fall into a range of $2,0282,035 per ounce, as suggested by its wave pattern and projection analysis,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.The Japanese yen (JPY) rebounded from 146.000 on Friday as the
US dollar
rose.On Friday, trading activity was low in Asia as the Japanese market was closed due to a holiday. The Japanese yen fell by 2.5% last week due to a substantial resurgence of the US dollar, as anticipations of immediate interest rate cuts by the US central bank this year decreased. However, recent comments from Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda caused speculation about Japan potentially moving away from its negative interest rate monetary policy. Last month, Ueda mentioned an increasing probability that Japan is leaving a period of low inflation and reaching its price stability goal. He further noted that the board might consider altering its monetary policy if the positive feedback loop between wages and prices strengthens and the chance of sustainably meeting the 2% inflation target becomes more likely.USD/JPY
was falling during the early European trading session. Investors await US inflation data on Thursday for additional insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy this year and next week's Japan inflation report to understand the local interest rate path.

Yahoo Finance,I'm Almost 60 and Have $1 Million in My IRA. Should I Switch to Roth Contributions?,2024-01-08,0.666667,"A 60-year-old man considers whether to contribute to a Roth IRA instead of a traditional IRA.Should you switch from pre-tax IRA contributions to Roth contributions?Imagine that youre steadily contributing to a
traditional IRA
. This provides you with an annual tax deduction. However, contributing to a tax-deferred account comes at the cost of having to pay taxes on all of the money you withdraw in retirement. Switching to a
Roth IRA
would reverse this dynamic, leaving you with less capital after paying taxes upfront in exchange for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals.As with all tax questions, the right decision will depend on your circumstances. The answer here may be to speak with a professional to determine what you should do. But in the meantime, here are a few things to think about.(And if you need help finding a financial advisor, consider using this
free matching tool
to connect with one.)Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRAA traditional IRA is what's called a pre-tax or tax-deferred account. You don't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it. However, youll owe
income tax
on the full balance  your original investment plus any gains.A Roth IRA is an after-tax account. You don't get a tax deduction for your contributions but you typically pay no taxes on the money when you withdraw it. That means your money grows tax-free. A bonus of Roth IRAs is that they arent subject to
required minimum distributions
(RMDs), which can increase your tax bill in retirement. (Remember, a
financial advisor
can potentially help you navigate RMDs and build a plan for limiting your tax liability in retirement.)Both types of IRAs have the same
annual contribution limits
. In tax year 2024, you can contribute up to $7,000 to your IRAs, plus an additional $1,000 if youre 50 or older. For tax year 2023, the IRS limits contributions to $6,500, plus the extra $1,000 if youre 50 or older.Opportunity Cost"

Yahoo Finance,The Federal Reserve Signals Interest Rate Cuts in 2024. History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.,2024-01-08,0.666667,"The Federal Reserve is charged with promoting maximum employment and price stability. To achieve those goals, it uses certain monetary policy tools to push the federal funds rate higher or lower. For context, the federal funds rate is a benchmark interest rate that influences other rates across the economy, including credit cards, personal loans, and mortgages.Ultimately, raising interest rates reduces spending and employment, which slows economic growth and brings inflation down. Conversely, lowering interest rates promotes spending and hiring, which accelerates economic growth and allows inflation to drift upward. The Federal Reserve, therefore, adjusts the federal funds target rate based on its monetary policy goals at any given time.In March 2022, officials began raising the benchmark rate to cool fierce inflation brought on by stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. The benchmark rate has since increased at its fastest pace in four decades, meaning credit conditions have tightened incredibly quickly. That dynamic is shown in the chart below.Image source"

Investing.com,The Reckoning in Pension Funds Draws Closer,2024-01-08,0.333333,"By Clint Siegner, Money Metals Exchange
The outlook for pension systems is growing increasingly dire. Promises made to retirees have been generous and they can only be kept if prices for all kinds of assets move consistently higher.
The trouble is that the past three years dont look like the first twenty years of the century.
The 40-year bull market in bonds ended. Commercial real estate is in deep trouble. And there are many indications that a recession is coming, which should translate to lower stock prices.
Now some large pension programs are looking to borrow money to meet their obligations. The union-boss-controlled California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) announced plans to borrow $30 billion in an effort to avoid selling distressed real estate and bonds.
They dont have much choice. Cutting retirement benefits is forbidden by law.
For some systems in certain locales, such as the government employee pensions in Illinois, changing the law means amending the states constitution -- a political impossibility.
The CalSTRS move to borrow roughly 10% of its total asset value smells of desperation. It is a gamble which pays off if there is a big recovery in commercial real estate and bond prices.
The outlook for commercial real estate remains gloomy. The retail sector has struggled for years due to the ongoing transition from brick-and-mortar to online shopping.
More recently demand for office space has been in decline. Work from home was a trend prior to COVID, and it massively accelerated during the pandemic.
The most likely scenario for a recovery in bond prices involves a decline in stock prices.
The Fed isnt likely to start dropping interest rates until stock market weakness signals recession or even worse economic malaise.
If markets fall, it will only get harder and more expensive for pensions to borrow next time.
The alternatives to borrowing will be a fire sale of assets, or a bailout from either the state or federal government.
Given that California is facing a record $68 billion deficit and federal deficits are also skyrocketing, bailouts could be a difficult sell. Liberal California state politicians will likely want to rescue pensions, but they will have to borrow to do it. The states creditworthiness could be an issue.
At the federal level, a bailout to maintain lavish retirement benefits for teachers in California is going to be a hard sell among representatives from more conservative states.
Overextended pension systems managed to stay afloat when prices for equity, real estate and bonds all moved higher. The promises made to retirees assumed a mostly uninterrupted bull market in financial assets.
Few state pension systems allocate any of their assets to physical precious metals in order to protect retirees from inflation and credit risk. One notable exception is the Ohio Police and Firefighters Pension Fund which reported acquired a physical
gold
holding.
Now pension systems that are hitched entirely to financial assets must navigate potential bear markets and tighter borrowing conditions. Many of them may not succeed."
Investing.com,Jobs,2024-01-08,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Every month, we get a strong non-farm payroll report with a big headline number. Every month the market reacts with a stock market drop, a spike in dollar strength, and a selloff in
gold
, all in anticipation that the Federal Reserve will respond to the strong labor market by leaving interest rates higher for longer.
And every month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revises previous months' job numbers lower.
Thats the part nobody pays attention to.
For December, the BLS reported 216,000 new jobs. This was far higher than the 170,000 new jobs projected and resulted in the aforementioned knee-jerk reaction from the markets.
And then there were the revisions.
The BLS revised the November jobs number down to 173,000. It was originally reported as 199,000 new jobs. At the time, this was reported as slightly better than the 190,000 Dow Jones estimate. But we now know the real number was a big miss. It wasn't ""slightly better"" than the estimate. It was ""way worse.""
The BLS also revised Octobers number down to 105,000 new jobs created. The BLS originally reported 150,000 new jobs created in October.
Thats 71,000 jobs that just poof disappeared with no fanfare.
And this isnt an anomaly.
The BLS revised 10 of the last 11 non-farm payroll reports lower.
Notice the pattern.
By the way, the fantastic December jobs report wasnt that great when you dig into the numbers. A big chunk of those new jobs were government jobs (52,000). There was a record 1.5 million crash in the number of full-time jobs. The labor force participation clicked downward. And we have more and more Americans working multiple jobs trying to make ends meet. (Every time some guy starts delivering pizzas at night on top of his day job to keep up with rising prices, that counts as a new job.)
But thats not even the point.
Even if we take the BLS numbers at face value and cheer because the economy created more jobs than projected, history tells us that the agency will revise those numbers down next month, and theres a pretty darn good chance that December's beat will turn into a miss.
And nobody will notice.
The markets only react to the initial numbers. You never see a gold rally because the BLS erased a bunch of jobs from the economy with a few clicks of its calculator. The revisions happen quietly in the back alleys. Nobody pays any attention to them. That creates the illusion that the labor market is much stronger than it actually is.
So, why should we trust any of these numbers, much less make decisions based on them?
And notice that the revisions are always down. If the BLS was making honest mistakes month after month, you would think sometimes they would underestimate the number of jobs created. But they always overestimate the numbers. If you flipped a coin and it came up heads 10 out of 11 times, youd start to wonder about the integrity of that coin, wouldnt you?
Again, its important to wrap your head around the pattern here.
This month, the government reports good news. Everybody celebrates. Markets move. The following month, the government quietly revises everything downward and reports that the good news was really bad news.
And nobody pays attention.
It might be a good idea to pay attention -- to the revisions too. Things arent nearly as rosy as the headlines would indicate."

Oregon tax records last month disclosed the name of the beneficial owner as Shanda Asset Management, the same moniker as Chens Singapore-based holding group.His Oregon property makes him one of the biggest individual owners of American land by a non-US citizen. Only the Irving family of Canada  No. 6 on the Land Reports list with over 1.2 million acres of Maine timberland  owns more.Foreign ownership of US land  particularly land used for farming  has become a sensitive political issue in recent years. About 40 million acres of American agricultural land was owned by non-US interests as of 2021, according to the most recent Department of Agriculture data, with entities from China owning the equivalent of .03% of all US farmland.Some lawmakers have pushed for national rules restricting foreign investment in American agricultural property. The Senate voted in July to ban the sale of farmland beyond a certain acreage or value to people or businesses from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, but the measure wasnt ultimately signed into law. Almost half of all states have some sort of restrictions on foreign ownership.Read More"

Reigning supreme is Denise Coates, the CEO and founder of Bet365a betting powerhouseand Britain's wealthiest woman.Coates launched the online website at the turn of the Millennium, and since then has attracted more than 90 million customers from across the world. The business is still based in the small city where Coates was born, but raked in 3.39 billion ($4.3 billion) in 2023.According to its latest accounts, seen by
Fortune
, Coates took home a massive pay cheque for her work in 2023. Documents published on Companies House say the business' top-paid director was awarded a sum of 220.6 million ($280 million).A representative for the business
confirmed to Bloomberg
that Coates was the company's highest-paid director. Bet365 did not respond to
Fortune's
request for comment.The figure was awarded despite the company's main sports and gaming division operating at a loss of more than 60 million ($76 million) for the year, but despite the losses, Coates's 2023 take-home is an increase on what she was paid last year; a nine-figure sum of $271.7 million.But the good times for Coates don't stop there.In the year to March 2023, the company paid out exactly 100 million ($127.4 million) in dividends.As the company's majority shareholderwith a stake of 58.3%the CEO would have had a further boost in the region of 50 million ($63.7 million), bringing her total compensation package to approximately 270 million ($344 million).According to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, Coates has received approximately1.5 billion in salary and dividends over the past decade.More than the Prime Ministerand Big Tech chiefsThe accounts therefore reveal that Coatescertainly for the past few yearsis earning more than her nation's Prime Minister and a handful of Big Tech CEOs to boot.Story continuesBritain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is
entitled to a salary of up to 198,661
($252,700) a year, while
Google
CEO Sundar Pichai's
most recent compensation package was $226 million.Likewise, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg notoriously is paid just $1 in salary, with
Metas proxy statement for 2023
revealing its founder and CEO also didnt partake in the companys bonus scheme.Zuckerberg was also not awarded any further equity in Meta because [the businesss] compensation, nominating, and governance committee believed that his existing equity ownership position sufficiently continued to align his interests with those of our shareholders.However, Zuckerbergs compensation for 2022 did come to more than $27 million, the statement added, as a result of Zuckerbergs security program.In a
proxy statement released in April 2023
,it was revealed that
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy took home $1,298,723 in 2022
. The total is made up of a salary of $317,500 and $981,223 in 401(k) payments and additional security costs.The
seven-figure sum indicates
a more than 99% cut from the long-term compensation package outlined for Jassy the year before, when he was awarded $212 million in stock to be vested over 10 years.Meanwhile over at
Microsoft
, chairman and CEO Satya Nadella received $54,946,310
in 2022
. Thats up from $49,858,280 the year prior
courtesy of an increase in stock awards.However, with Coates's fortune expected by Bloomberg to drop 40% to approximately $4 billion as a result of Bet365's losses, the trend of Coates out-earning her Silicon Valley rivals may not last for long.This story was originally featured on

Yahoo Finance,Ask an Advisor,2024-01-08,0.666667,"Financial advisor and columnist Brandon RenfroI'm 55 and would like to retire now with a $3 million total net worth. I'm assuming my net worth will grow, on average, 5% until Im eligible for Social Security. My house is paid off and my lifestyle is simple. I can live with $5,000 per month. Am I making the right decisions? PeterAt first blush, supporting $5,000 in monthly living expenses on $3 million seems like an easy feat. But I like to start by thinking about scenarios like this in terms of your
distribution rate
 the percentage of your money you'll be withdrawing each year. Withdrawing $60,000 per year would equate to just a 2% annual withdrawal rate, which is incredibly low by pretty much anyones standards. That would put you at very little risk of running out of money.However, since you say ""
net worth
"" instead of nest egg or savings, I would encourage you to take a hard look at how your net worth is composed. Are your assets mostly liquid, like stocks and cash? Or is your net worth primarily tied up in illiquid assets, such as real estate? The answer may dictate how much you can afford to withdraw. (And if you need more help determining when you can retire,
consider speaking with a financial advisor
.)Examining Your Net WorthYour net worth is the value of all of your assets minus any debts. For example, if you own a property that's worth $500,000 and have a $300,000
mortgage
, it contributes $200,000 to your net worth. Of course, your investments, cash and other savings all contribute to your net worth as well.I mention this because the way your $3 million net worth is spread across different types of assets can affect how capable you are of supporting yourself with it. All assets don't provide the same level of flexibility.To illustrate my point, consider this hypothetical scenario"

What Can I Do With It?",2024-01-08,0.666667,"While many retirement accounts offer tax-sheltered ways to save and invest, the IRS mandates accountholders start withdrawing money at a certain point. This takes the form of required minimum distributions (RMDs).
Required minimum distributions
currently start at age 73 for many retirement accounts.Its not uncommon to reach an age when the IRS requires you to start withdrawing money from retirement accounts that you dont need to tap just yet. RMDs can trigger taxes and likely wont generate a competitive return in your checking account. Instead, here are some ways to think about managing this money.If youre looking to build a tax-efficient plan for retirement,
talk to a financial advisor today.Why Plan for RMDs?Required minimum distributions, or RMDs, are withdrawals that the IRS requires you to make from most tax-advantaged retirement accounts. They apply to all pre-tax accounts, such as IRAs and 401(k)s. They do not apply to
Roth IRAs
and, effective 2024, will no longer apply to
Roth 401(k)s
.Starting at age 73,
everyone
with a qualifying account must take this minimum withdrawal each year.This rule applies per-account, not per-taxpayer. So, say you have both an IRA and a 401(k), then each account will have its own minimum annual withdrawal. The
IRS calculates
your minimum withdrawals
based on
your age and the accounts value.For example, say that you turned 73 this year and have $500,000 in an IRA. The IRS
would
require you to withdraw at least $18,867 from this IRA by the end of 2023.With a $1 million retirement account, an annual minimum withdrawal of $37,735 would be required.These are the rules for retirement accounts that you contributed to. Inherited retirement accounts also have required minimum distributions for heirs who receive them. Often you must withdraw this money within 10 years of inheriting it, but
the specifics
vary widely based on the nature of the account and its original owner.Remember, a
financial advisor
can help you determine the best way to structure your withdrawals.Story continuesWhat Can You Do With Your RMDs?At age 73 you can realistically have decades ahead of you, so dont just take out this cash and put it into a depository account. A few ways you can make the money work for you include"

(AP)  Following the settlement of a lawsuit pitting Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam against fellow billionaire Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway, the clock is ticking for the Haslam family to decide whether to sell its remaining stake in the Pilot truck stop chain to Berkshire.Attorneys told a Delaware judge last week that they were prepared for a two-day trial starting Monday in a high-stakes dispute over accounting practices at Pilot Travel Centers LLC. Late Saturday, however, the judge entered an order indicating that the trial had been canceled.On Sunday, Haslams Pilot Corp. announced that the case, including Berkshires counterclaims against Pilot Corp., had been fully settled. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.With the dispute resolved, the Haslams must now decide whether to sell their remaining 20% stake in Pilot Travel Centers to Berkshire in line with a 2017 business deal. PTC, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee, is a diversified fuel company that operates more than 650 travel centers, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, in 43 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces.A spokeswoman for Pilot Corp. declined to comment Monday on whether the Haslam family, which includes former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, will sell its remaining stake in PTC to Berkshire. A spokeswoman for Berkshire did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Berkshire purchased an initial 38.6% stake in PTC in 2017 for $2.76 billion. The two sides agreed at that time that Berkshire would take control of PTC by acquiring an additional 41.4% interest in January 2023. The price tag for that control purchase was roughly $8.2 billion.The 2017 agreements also gave Pilot Corp. an annual 60-day opportunity, beginning Jan. 1 this year, to sell its remaining 20% interest in PTC to Berkshire. The sale price would be calculated using PTCs earnings in the prior year.With the first sale deadline approaching, however, the two sides accused each other of trying to manipulate the companys financial records in order to affect the price Berkshire would have to pay for the Haslam familys remaining 20% stake in the truck-stop chain.Story continuesIn a Chancery Court complaint, attorneys for Haslam noted that an SEC filing by Berkshire last year listed Pilot Corp.s redeemable noncontrolling interest in PTC at about $3.2 billion. Pilot alleged, however, that after taking control of PTC, Berkshire adopted pushdown accounting, that resulted in the company reporting lower net income. Pilot claimed that a 2017 agreement prevents Berkshire from making such an accounting change without Pilots consent.Berkshire responded with allegations that Haslam
tried to bribe employees
at the Pilot truck stop chain to inflate the companys value in order to increase the amount Berkshire would have to pay.An attorney for Pilot told the Delaware judge last month that federal prosecutors have begun an investigation based on Berkshires bribery allegations."

These are the topics which willbe covered.Since we are dealing with financial markets, which are non-linear and uncertain environments, I want to make it clear upfront that depression is obviously not a foregone conclusion.Therefore, I will end this series of articles outlining what I will need to see over the coming two years to tell me whether we are indeed heading into a 13-21-year bear market.And, if the market takes the path I lay out over the coming two years, then it will make a long-term bear market a high probability.Until such time, I am going to be taking my cues from the market action week by week and month by month, and will not likely take on an extreme bearish posture until I see strong confirmation in the next year or two.But, I will likely be raising a lot of cash in the coming months.So let's get started.Those who have followed my analysis over the last 13 years know that I have caught most (but not all, as we are not perfect) of the major turns in all the assets I cover.While I only cover the
S&P 500
and sometimes the metals publicly over the last several years, our clients that have been with me for over a decade know how well we have done.This was recently said by a client who has been with me for a bit over a decade"
Investing.com,"Gold Price Continues to Drop, EUR/USD Remains Strong",2024-01-09,0.333333,"The gold (XAU) price dropped by 0.87% on Monday as the US Treasury yields remained elevated due to decreasing expectations for a soon interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed).XAU/USD
started the year on a bearish note and has lost 1.4% since 29 December. The main reason for the decline is the decreasing expectations for the Fed's interest rate cut in March 2024. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the market currently prices in a 57% chance of a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut in March, while in late December, the probability was close to 90%. Better-than-expected Friday's nonfarm payroll numbers, showing more than expected jobs added in December, prompted some investors to doubt whether the rate cut will be soon.Today, the gold prices rebounded towards 2,030 as the
US dollar
weakened slightly during the early European trading session. 'Spot gold may retest support of $2,016 per ounce, a break below could open the way towards $2,006,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.EUR/USD

Investing.com,Stock markets flirt with record highs,2024-01-09,0.444444,
Investing.com,2024 Survey,2024-01-09,0.666667,"During the last week of December, I polled my Twitter followers for their outlook on the markets and the economy for 2024. The results were quite interesting, but before we look forward, we must look back at 2023 for context.Last year was not what the majority of mainstream economists and analysts predicted.Going into last year, expectations for a recession and negative market returns were high. The table below shows some important events and market reactions during the previous year for the
S&P 500
. Each one of those events was expected to disrupt the market.Yet, despite higher Fed funds rates, rising interest rates, bank failures, and fiscal concerns, the market closely followed the seasonal pattern of a pre-election year.The correction during the summer certainly had the bears coming out of hibernation, but the bulls were entirely in charge by year-end. The chart is the combined net bullish sentiment index (professional and retail) compared to the S&P 500 index.So, with the understanding that 2023 defied all previous expectations, what do investors enter 2024 think regarding the market and the economy?With the S&P 500 ending the year 24% higher than where it started, 42% believe 2024 will end lower than the years close of 4769.However, if we split the 4600-5000 band, roughly 50% think the year will be lower. Interestingly, 24% expect returns above the 2024 market consensus of 5200.Of course, for the market to generate those returns, the economy must avoid a recession. When asked that question, 45% of those polled believe there is more than a 50% chance of a recession, with 13.6% at a 100% conviction.Here is the problem with that view. In an economic downturn, the market must reprice earnings for slower economic growth.Therefore, given that 2023 was a year driven by multiple expansions, there is significant room for a repricing of earnings if a recession develops.Given that recent economic data has slowed, the more optimistic view of the market will become more challenging as forward earnings estimates continue to decline.Following that poll question of recession expectations, I asked about real
GDP
growth
(inflation-adjusted).
40.2% of those polled expect the economy to avoid a recession but exhibit growth below 2%. Only 28% expect a recession.Again, given that earnings are derived from economic activity, the problem of current growth estimates will be more challenging to obtain.Such is mainly the case given that earnings growth estimates for 2024 are highly elevated relative to historical norms.With valuations on the rise, as earnings fail to keep pace with price increases, the risk of a repricing event increases if earnings fail to meet current expectations.What could keep earnings under pressure? Such would be a slower economy impacted by higher inflation, unemployment, and interest rates.The 2024 poll became more interesting when explicitly asked about the underlying factors of the economy. For example, more than 68% of those polled believed the
unemployment rate
would rise above 4% this year.Given last Fridays BLS employment reports sharp drop in full-time employment, there is certainly some evidence to suggest economic deterioration is in process.
(We will discuss this in further detail on Friday.)However, if employment is expected to fall, then higher rates of inflation are much less probable.Such is because of the supply/demand relationship that drives employment over time. Therefore, the 65% of respondents who believe inflation will be higher than 3% over the next year will likely be disappointed.Another dichotomy in the survey was interest rates. Most respondents also think interest rates will be higher over the next year.The issue is the high correlation between inflation, interest rates, wages, and economic growth. Such was a point
discussed
previously.While it is not near recessionary levels yet, the data trend is slowing. As noted, with an 87% correlation to economic growth, the slower pace will eventually manifest in lower interest rates and inflation.Given that these polls were taken over a week, the participants in the survey were not the same. Such accounts for the diversity of responses in the poll.While you should not make any assumptions from these polls, the responses were interesting. Overall, most participants are more bearish on the markets and economy for the coming year.This was the case last year, and the markets defied those expectations.However, a critical takeaway is that the economy can not be weaker and have higher inflation and interest rates. If employment is slowing, as it looks like, the real risk is slower economic growth, lower rates, and further disinflation.If such is the case, the current earnings growth expectations this year remain elevated even though they have already been revised lower.Such potentially creates the potential for investor disappointment and a repricing of markets to correspond with reduced valuation assumptions.While we have no idea how 2024 will eventually turn out, the risk is that the markets may defy more bearish expectations again, hoping the Federal Reserve will offset any risk with accommodative actions.Or maybe this is the year the
Bears
get it right.The best we can do is pay attention to the changes in the data, manage risk, and be willing to change our views as needed."

Yahoo Finance,I'm 55 With a $2 Million Net Worth and $6k in Monthly Expenses. Can I Retire Now?,2024-01-09,0.555556,"Retiring early raises a series of questions around both income and spending. You will need to manage your portfolio for longer-term drawdowns, an early end to new earnings, and a long wait for Social Security to kick in. You will need to manage your spending around new needs, particularly health insurance, long-term care insurance and a largely fixed income.But with certain considerations, it looks like you have the right assets in place. You will need some investments, since without growth your portfolio likely isn't enough to pay for your lifestyle through a lengthy retirement. But you won't need aggressive or unrealistic returns, putting you in a comfortable position to enjoy the good life today.Here are a few things to think about, in addition to talking through your plan with a
financial advisor.Plan for Secure, but Steady, Portfolio ReturnsThis portfolio should last you for a long time, said Matt WillerManaging Director of Capital Markets, Partner, at
Phoenix Capital Group Holdings, LLC,
provided you invest it wisely. Fortunately, wisely doesn't have to mean speculatively.""Interest rates [today] allow investors today to comfortably generate 5-6% annual yields with virtually no risk Assuming all the savings are taxable, and not in qualified accounts, this translates to at least $100-120k in annual gross interest income, and post taxes is still beyond sufficient to meet the $6,000 after tax expense requirement,"" said Willer.You can increase this even more by accepting modest risk into your portfolio. A blended portfolio, with a good mix of bonds and stocks, will often return an average 8%  11% return said Willer. This can not only provide a generous retirement income and lifestyle, albeit one that will require some risk-management plans but will give you a hedge against inflation.Talk to a financial advisor
about the best investment strategy for you.Invest and Prepare for Personal InflationHedging inflation should be a major priority, and national inflation and your personal inflation may not always be the same thing.Story continuesThe Federal Reserve sets a benchmark inflation rate of around 2%, typically accepting any number between 2% and 3%. That rate alone will double your costs of living roughly every 30 years. Your personal spending power may erode even faster, said,Vijay Marolia,Managing Partner of
Regal Point Capital
, because of the costs associated with how and where you live.This is
personal inflation,
the idea that the costs you pay for your life and lifestyle may grow more quickly than the national averages.For example, say that you rent an apartment in a popular city. Historically, your housing costs will increase much faster than 2%. If you enjoy travel, then your entertainment costs have surged over the past two years. Meat eaters have seen their grocery bills rise faster than vegetarians, and pedestrians aren't as individually worried about gas prices.All of this can mean that your household's costs might not match the national CPI.For example, said Marolia, assume that you have 5% returns from an income-generating portfolio. After taxes that will leave you with $6,250 per month, meeting your current needs.""Don't get too excited, because what looks like a $250 per month surplus may not remain as such; it's only a 4% margin. If one experiences a personal inflation rate of only 5% than this eats the entire surplus and some. Why? Because at 5% inflation, monthly expenses rise to $6,300 per month, or $50 less than you need,""Marolia said.This isn't a dealbreaker, you still have enough money saved up to manage this risk. Just make sure that you do manage it.A
financial advisor
can help you map out budget projections for your retirement.Early Retirement IssuesPersonal inflation is a particularly important issue for early retirees.The reason to retire at 55 is so that you can enjoy your lifestyle. It would defeat the entire point if you priced yourself out of your standard of living. So make sure that you invest for the kind of growth you will need to stay comfortable, not just barely making it on a fixed budget.Beyond that, it's important to remember that early retirement adds a host of new issues to your retirement planning. Two of the most important are health care and
Social Security
.First, you will need to anticipate health insurance.
Medicare
won't kick in until age 65 and, until then, most people rely on their employer for insurance coverage. By retiring early you will need to buy your own coverage. Unless you currently pay for insurance, this will probably add
about $500
to your anticipated monthly budget.Even once Medicare does kick in, you will still need to budget for
gap
and
long-term care insurance
, so don't count on that extra spending to fall off.Second, make a plan for Social Security. One of the good things about having a well-funded retirement account is that you can delay taking Social Security, which will make those benefits more generous in the long run. Indeed, based on your numbers, collecting Social Security age at 70 can be a significant part of your inflation hedge. Just make sure you include this in your overall plan, because that money won't roll in for another 15 years.Consider
matching with a financial advisor
if you still have questions about the best way to finance your retirement.The Bottom LineAt age 55 with $2 million in the bank, you are well positioned to retire early. Just make sure that you anticipate the complicated issues around early retirement, including long-term inflation hedges and health insurance.Early Retirement TipsIf not every budget and inflation profile was made the same, nor was every retirement destination. Some states are simply cheaper to retire in, more fun to retire in or more comfortable in the long run.
Depending on how flexible you are about location, that can be an important part of your retirement plans.

blown out in mid-air
during a Alaska Airlines flight on Friday was the focus of a class-action lawsuit filed less than a month earlier, with the complaint alleging that Spirit AeroSystems had experienced ""sustained quality failures"" in its products.The complaint, filed on December 19 in federal court in New York, was filed on behalf of investors in Spirit AeroSystems, which was originally a manufacturing unit of Boeing until it was spun off in 2005 (The company has no relationship with Spirit Airlines.) According to the suit, Spirit relies heavily on Boeing for orders and manufactures much of the aviation giant's jet fuselages.The midair incident involved a door plug, panels designed to fit into doors that typically aren't needed on an aircraft, transforming them into windows. One of these plugs was sucked out of a

While none of the issues flagged in the lawsuit specifically involve door plugs, the claim alleges that Spirit's ""quality failures were so severe and persistent that Boeing even placed Spirit on probation for multiple years.""Spirit declined to comment on the litigation.

Yahoo Finance,Why Apple faces its biggest crisis since it was saved by the iPod,2024-01-09,0.222222,"Apple iPhoneTim Cook did not hold back. This is obviously a disaster, he told finance executives in a 2018 email, ordering his lieutenants to improve underwhelming sales of Apples latest iPhones.Apples business in China was sliding, leading to the companys first profit warning in 16 years. One executive described the performance as an extreme problem, while another said employees needed to respond as if it was a five alarm fire, according to emails recently released as part of a lawsuit against Apple.The company later reported two consecutive quarters of revenue decline, a rare dip for a business famous for reliably getting more cash out of its customers each year.At the time, blame for the poor sales was laid at the foot of
Huawei, the Chinese phone giant
seen as a domestic rival to the iPhone maker.I do think upgraders consider choices [like Huawei] to be more value for money, especially if they dont see major reasons and new innovation in the iPhone, wrote Apples head of marketing for China.Ultimately, Huawei did not kill Apples business in China. US sanctions effectively
crippled Huaweis ability to make high-end handsets
, handing an advantage to the iPhone maker in the process.Despite fraying relations between Beijing and Washington, Apple went on to post record sales in the Middle Kingdom.But Cook may have simply delayed the reckoning. Wall Street has recently sounded a new alarm on Apples business in China, sending the companys shares sliding.It is just one of a number of significant issues facing the worlds biggest company.In November, the company revealed revenues had fallen year-on-year for four consecutive quarters, the longest slump for more than two decades. Some analysts believe Apple could deliver a fifth quarter of decline when it reports Christmas sales in the coming weeks.This would mark its longest losing streak since 1998, the year after Steve Jobs returned to save the company from near-bankruptcy.Story continuesNobody is suggesting that Apple or Cook are in similar trouble.

inflation report
for December for markets, which are pricing in relatively upbeat news.Quite a lot of the stock markets upbeat profile recently is closely linked to forecasts that the worst has passed for inflation, which leaves room for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates.In that case, the market has a green light to reprice equity prices up, which its been doing to no trivial degree in recent months.Meanwhile, US Treasury yields have fallen recently, largely for the same reason. Tomorrows CPI report will provide a reality check on the rosy assumptions of late.Economists expect a bit of a mixed bag. For the year-over-year headline data, consumer inflation is projected to tick up to 3.2% from 3.1% in November.Thats still well below the recent trend, but the Feds 2% inflation target appears set to remain elusive for the immediate horizon.The sticky headline data will be offset by expectations for softer
core CPI
reading, which strips out food and energy in a bid to estimate a more reliable measure of the trend.This estimate of pricing pressure is on track to ease to 3.8% year-over-year in December. If correct, this crucial measure of inflation will dip below 4% for the first time in nearly three years.Nonetheless, Vanguards senior international economist says that Prices continue to fall at a rapid clip vs. the start of 2023, but Andrew Patterson doesnt expect that the Feds 2% target will arrive until late this year at the earliest.Pattersons outlook aligns with CapitalSpectator.coms econometric forecast for core CPI, based on a proprietary ensemble model. By the end of 2024, this estimate of year-over-year inflation is projected to slide to just over 2%, based on the point forecast.The case for expecting ongoing disinflation also looks persuasive via a set of alternative measures of pricing pressure (for a list, see p. 3 of this sample issue of The US Inflation Trend Chartbook, a companion newsletter for subscribers to The US Business Cycle Risk Report).In the chart below, the sliding trend remains intact and looks set to persist for the near term.For another perspective, consider how the bias compares in the chart above. In the next chart below, theres a clear downside bias for the monthly changes in the year-over-year data points.Although the numbers suggest more progress lies ahead in the battle to tame inflation, the potential for upside surprises can never be ruled out, particularly in the short term.But looking through the noise that could muddy the waters for any given month, the disinflation trend remains on track, even if thats not always obvious for anyone CPI update.Sam Bullard, managing director and chief economist for Wells Fargos corporate and investment banking group"

Investing.com,Bulls Need Goldilocks Soft-Landing Scenario to Keep Reining Supreme,2024-01-10,0.666667,"Market narratives have been around for ages. However, the internet and, more recently, social media allow narratives to spread much quicker. Accordingly, they have become more frequent and potent market forces.Following economic data, corporate earnings, politics, global affairs, and many other factors are still crucial for investors.Equally important, especially over short periods, is identifying which narrative(s) most heavily impact markets.Todays popular narrative is a growing consensus for the Fed to engineer a soft landing and a Goldilocks economy. Its worth appreciating the Fed and Jerome Powell, purposely or not, started the narrative.As the fiscal stimulus that drove above-average economic growth in the post-pandemic era exits the system and monetary policy remains very tight, economists and investors wonder what comes next.The scenario rapidly gaining in popularity is the Goldilocks narrative.In case you forgot, Goldilocks and The Three Bears start with Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear leaving their house for a walk while their porridge cools.Goldilocks enters their home and tastes the three bowls of porridge. Papas is too hot, and Mamas is too cold. Baby Bears is just right. She also finds Babys chair and bed are just right, not too hard or soft. Goldilocks prefers things just right.Like the tale, a Goldilocks economic scenario is a slowdown to more sustainable growth rates. Such does not involve a recession or high inflation. For most asset markets, its a dream scenario.Regardless of what you or I think, markets are currently taking their cue from Goldilocks, at least until the next narrative takes charge.On November 1, 2023, the Fed hinted that the Goldilocks era is in view.

Robert Kiyosaki
presents a compelling view on financial literacy that distinguishes the wealthy from the less affluent. His key principle is that the rich do not work for money in the conventional sense. Instead, they focus on acquiring assets and building wealth through strategic investments and business ventures.In a
TikTok post
from December 2022, Kiyosaki emphasized this concept in an interview, saying, If you read Rich Dad, Poor Dad, rich dads lesson No. 1  rich dont work for money. He went on to say, The people that are being screwed today are the poor middle class because they work for money.He said he believes that the rich are adept at navigating economic challenges, seeing them as opportunities to acquire undervalued assets and invest in innovation. In contrast, those in poverty often exacerbate their situation by incurring more debt.Kiyosakis philosophy centers around the idea of working to learn, not just to earn. He argues that true financial success comes from developing financial intelligence, a mindset that helped him transition from an employee to an entrepreneur. This shift in focus from earning a paycheck to acquiring knowledge and skills is pivotal in achieving financial freedom.Don't Miss"

Getty ImagesThe S&P 500 could jump 10% to a record 5,200 points this year, Jeremy Siegel says.
The ""Wizard of Wharton"" says the Fed's willingness to cut rates is more important than doing so.
Siegel warns that a flurry of cuts might signal a recession that could pull down stocks.The S&P 500 could surge by 10% to a record high of 5,200 points this year  and plunging interest rates could spell trouble for stocks, Jeremy Siegel says.The retired finance professor known as the ""Wizard of Wharton"" said the US economy is growing at a ""Goldilocks pace"" in his
WisdomTree commentary
this week. It's not expanding quickly enough to scare the Federal Reserve into cooling it down, but it's still strong enough to fuel growth in corporate earnings and shore up stocks, he said.""If real economic growth stays strong, the Fed could keep rates exactly where they are, and we could have strong equity markets,"" he said. The rosy economic backdrop could underpin an 8% to 10% rise in the S&P 500 this year, and push smaller-cap value stocks up 15% given their depressed valuations, he added.The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate from nearly zero to north of 5% since early 2022, in an effort to wrestle historic inflation back to its 2% target. Steeper borrowing costs can temper price growth by discouraging spending, investing, and hiring, but they can also sap demand so much that the economy shrinks and a recession takes hold.Siegel disagreed with the idea that the Fed needs to slash rates aggressively this year for stocks to perform well. The key thing is that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled he's ready to reverse some of the central bank's hikes if the economy weakens, he said.""That willingness to cut is more important than having the cut,"" he
told CNBC
on Monday. ""Honestly, I would love the economy to keep on chugging along, and if it chugs along at 5% fed funds, that's not bad for stocks.""Story continuesThe author of ""Stocks for the Long Run"" said he expected the Fed to lower rates as inflation cools further  a prospect he hailed as ""a real positive for the market going forward."" Yet he noted that a flurry of cuts could indicate a sharp economic slowdown that spooks consumers and investors and hits company earnings.""One has to realize big rate cuts might mean a real slowdown and recession,"" he said. ""Well, the stock market doesn't want that.""Siegel
has been bullish on stock and the economy for a while
. In December, he suggested that house prices could rise by 5% to 10% this year, inflation might slow to around 2.5%, the risk of recession was below 50%, and the Fed might cut rates by five or six times to below 4%.Read the original article on

Yahoo Finance,Do I really need supplemental insurance (Medigap) with Medicare?,2024-01-09,0.333333,"About 41% of Original Medicare beneficiaries had
Medicare Supplement Insurance
, or Medigap, in 2021, according to a February 2023 report summarizing enrollment data from AHIP, a national health insurance trade association. For the other 59%, Medicare has some gaps that could be costly.There are many gaps in Medicare that a beneficiary has to pay if they dont have a Medigap, Kelli Jo Greiner, Minnesota State Health Insurance Assistance Program director, said in an email. This can add up to be thousands of dollars per year.While its not mandatory, you might want to purchase a Medigap policy to fill some of the gaps in Medicare Part A and/or Part B. (Medigap doesnt work with Medicare Advantage policies.)DEDUCTIBLESMedicare Part A has a deductible of $1,632 in 2024, which you owe before Medicare starts to pay for inpatient hospital care.Just one hospital stay, youre going to be paying that $1,632 deductible  so, really fast, your costs can add up, says Joanne Giardini-Russell, CEO of Giardini Medicare, an independent insurance agency.Most Medigap plans cover the Part A deductible. And plans with premiums below $136 per month could put you ahead based on that benefit alone.(New Medicare members cant buy Medigap plans that cover Part Bs relatively smaller deductible of $240 in 2024, so youd still owe that amount out of pocket.)COINSURANCE AND COPAYSAfter youve met your deductible, there are out-of-pocket costs for many Medicare services. For example, you pay a 20% coinsurance for most medically necessary outpatient services covered by Part B.Medicare Part A copays kick in after your 60th day in the hospital. They start at $408 per day in 2024 and get more expensive for longer stays.All Medigap policies include at least some coverage for Part A and Part B coinsurance and copays. If you use a lot of health care, that coverage could mean big out-of-pocket savings.OUT-OF-POCKET LIMITSUnlike many other kinds of insurance, Medicare Part A and Part B dont have maximum out-of-pocket caps. Theres no limit on what you could owe as copays and coinsurance add up.Story continuesOriginal Medicare without Medigap would be perilous because we need Medigap for the out-of-pocket limit, Michael Dayoub, a certified financial planner in Savannah, Georgia, said in an email.Buying a Medigap policy is one way to put a cap on your yearly costs. Paying more upfront for premiums could pay off by limiting your future out-of-pocket spending.IS MEDIGAP WORTH THE COST?You can expect to pay $100-$150 per month or more for the most popular Medigap plan, Plan G, when you sign up at age 65. And premiums can go up based on plan type, age, location and sometimes health status.Thats a significant added expense  so is it worth it?Giardini-Russell compares Medigap to car insurance, which you pay for each month, even though you hope not to need it. It comes down a lot of times to the psychology and peace of mind, she says. Are you willing to pay $150 per month for peace of mind?We tend to hear from beneficiaries that they are very satisfied with their policy, Greiner said. Medigap is worth it if you can afford to pay the Medigap premiums along with your premiums for Medicare Part B and a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, according to Greiner.If Medigap isnt affordable, you might want to look into programs that can help with Medicare costs, such as Medicare Savings Programs and Extra Help subsidies.People who cant afford Medigap premiums could also consider Medicare Advantage, according to Dayoub. Medicare Advantage plans are bundled alternatives to Original Medicare sold by private insurance companies. They have out-of-pocket limits, but there are trade-offs to consider, such as limited provider networks.ENROLLMENT TIME LIMITSThe best and easiest time to buy a Medigap policy is right as youre turning 65. Your six-month Medigap open enrollment period starts when youre 65 and enrolled in Medicare Part B.During this period, insurance companies cant use medical underwriting to charge you more or deny coverage based on your health or medical history. After that, it can be more expensive or even impossible to get a Medigap policy.So if you want to buy in for peace of mind, dont miss your best chance. You can compare options on Medicare.gov, shop online or work with an agent or broker to find the best policy for you.______________________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

Chinese Billionaire Is Second-Biggest Foreign Owner of US LandLithium  the ultra-light metal used in electric-vehicle batteries  has plunged more than 80% from a late-2022 record, as the market whiplashed from shortage fears to a mountain of surplus inventories. Nickel and cobalt have also tumbled, weighed down by an influx of new production amid concerns that the shift to EVs may not be as smooth and quick as predicted.Its a dramatic reversal from the ebullience of recent years that sent prices soaring and sparked a rush by some of the auto industrys biggest players to secure future supply. Now, carmakers are getting cold feet and abandoning deal discussions, according to mining investment bankers and industry executives. The low prices are making it harder for mine builders to raise money from more traditional sources as well, at a time when the industry is also grappling with rampant inflation driving up the cost to build new projects.Chemaf Resources Ltd. last year put itself up for sale after a slump in the cobalt price left it struggling to finish key projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and London-based Horizonte Minerals Plc scaled back work on its Brazilian nickel mine as it searches for funds to complete construction, and announced an emergency $20 million financing late last year.Junior producers have been particularly hard hit. Australias Core Lithium Ltd. said last week it would halt mining operations at its Grants open pit mine until conditions improve, warning of a writedown, while nickel miner Panoramic Resources Ltd. is suspending its flagship mine after entering voluntary administration late last year when it failed to find a buyer or partner.Story continuesThe turmoil is likely to have long-term ramifications for supply, and stands in stark contrast to the growing emphasis by governments on securing future access to critical minerals.Building new mines takes years and sometimes decades, and stalled projects can often be hard to restart. And while most crucial battery markets are now in surplus, shortages are already forecast toward the end of the decade as the greening of the economy accelerates.In the case of lithium  a once-tiny commodity market that has been catapulted into the global spotlight due to its vital role in EV batteries  the extreme boom and bust of the last few years shows the difficulties in trying to forecast future supply-demand balances and prices, for both producers and their investors.Theres nothing magical about EV input markets like lithium and cobalt"

Yahoo Finance,"The housing market is heading for the affordability of 2 years ago, Morgan Stanley says. Heres why its home price forecast is unchanged",2024-01-09,0.555556,"Morgan Stanleys home price outlook is unchanged, but it does see something new in affordability, after a painful year for most homebuyers, as mortgage rates bit in a way they havent
since the 1980s
. James Egan, the banks co-head of U.S. securities products research, crunched the data on mortgage rates falling from their recent 8% peak to the 6% range, and sees affordability improving as early as next month to a point unseen since February 2021, which was less than halfway through the pandemic housing boom.This is needed since home prices have once again broken through to a new record high, the note said. Egan and his team cited data showing Octobers year-over-year increase of 4.8%. The catch, they say, is that mortgage rates decreased more than 50 basis points in December and close to 70 basis points the prior month. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is sitting at 6.8%much lower than Octobers 23-year high, but more than double the 3% range that put a floor under the pandemic era housing boom.Mortgage rates will also support Morgan Stanleys forecast from November, which sees prices mildly declining through 2024. While home prices continue to climb, as these lower rates filter through our affordability calculations the pace of deterioration has slowed to its most benign levels since 2Q21, the banks strategists wrote. If rates were to hold at these levels, [year-over-year] affordability could improve as soon as next monthwhich would be the first time this has been the case since February 2021.It is our expectation of increases here that has us continuing to expect a mild decrease in home prices in 2024 despite improved affordability and the growth in sales, the strategists wrote. In late November, the investment bank
forecast
a 3% drop in nationwide home prices through this year.If current mortgage rates were to hold, the strategists added, the monthly mortgage payment on a median-priced home would be $185 lower than Morgan Stanleys existing metric. That would bring the average monthly payment to its lowest level since April. Nonetheless, affordability has already improved some.Story continuesThe bank found that pending home sales and mortgage purchase applications remain soft, but the pace of their decline has moderated significantly, the note read, citing a 15% year-over-year decline in purchase applications and a 5% decline in pending home sales last month. But the investment bank predicts sales to increase this year, with existing-home sales jumping 2.5% year over year, and new-home sales 7.5%.While a faster improvement in affordability than we expected introduces upside risk to our forecastswe expect the absolute levels of affordability and inventory to keep growth from accelerating too quickly, they wrote.Existing-home sales
retreated to their slowest pace in more than a decadelargely a result of the lock-in effect, which refers to homeowners refusing to sell their homes for fear of losing their low mortgage rates. More than 90% of conventional borrowers have a mortgage rate less than or equal to 6%; nearly 87% have a rate less than or equal to 5%; almost 75% have a rate less than or equal to 4%, according to Morgan Stanley.However, the lock-in effect seems to be showing signs of easing, as existing-home sales rose in November after five consecutive monthly declines. Theyre still down more than 7% on an annual basis, and new-home sales are only up more than 1% year over year. But it is expected that supply will increase this year. For-sale inventory was virtually unchanged, in December, following seven consecutive months of declines. Months of supply, which refers to the number of months it would take for all the current homes for sale on the market to sell, has also increased to its highest level since May 2020, the note said.This story was originally featured on

Boeing CEO Fights Back Tears and Admits Our Mistake in 737 AddressIn November, 35% of candidates passed the Level I test, down from 37% for those who sat for the exam in August and 39% in May, the CFA Institute said Tuesday. Thats the lowest pass rate since 2021, when results hit record lows across all levels of the CFA exam as performance was hurt by the pandemic. Its also below the 40% average for the past decade, according to the institute.Though rates were starting to trend back toward historic averages, the latest results show the impact of those disruptions hasnt subsided completely. The institute continues to attribute the Level I pass-rate decline to test-taking deferrals, encouraging candidates to stay on schedule when possible.Prior exam deferrals impacted results for many candidates again, Chris Wiese, managing director for education at the institute, said in a statement. Some Level I candidates choose to defer their exams, and this continues to impact the overall pass rate.Almost 29,000 candidates sat for the Level I exam in November, which was administered at 480 testing centers around the world. Historically, the institute offered the exam on paper, but transitioned to computer-based testing during the pandemic.Those who took Level II of the exam in November are scheduled to receive their results next week, the institute said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTropical Underworld"

It made it clear Wednesday that its fourth-quarter earnings report Friday will be complicated, too.The giant New York-based bank said in a regulatory document it will take more than $3 billion in one-time reserves and expenses as part of those fourth-quarter results.They include everything from a $1.3 billion reserve build for currency exposure in Argentina and Russia to $780 million in charges related to severance costs and other aspects of a wide-ranging restructuring of the bank led by CEO Jane Fraser.Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser.

(REUTERS / Reuters)It will also report a charge of $1.7 billion to pay a special assessment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Other big banks will also be weighed down by similar FDIC assessments, which were used to cover the $18 billion in losses to the FDICs insurance fund from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last March.Citigroup had previously estimated this amount would be $1.65 billion.The disclosures Wednesday did not include full fourth-quarter results, so it is not yet how much of a hit these charges and expenses will apply to the bank's bottom line. Its stock fell more than 1% in after hours trading following the release.In a blog post Citigroup CFO Mark Mason said ""the items we disclosed today do not change our strategy.""He added that while we rarely provide information about the results of the quarter in advance of scheduled earnings announcement dates, we thought this was a prudent step in our commitment to building credibility and being transparent.""Citigroup is paring back its ambitions as it tries to revive its stock price and remove decades of bloat. Fraser is trying to focus the company on serving big, multinational corporations, shed what isn't profitable, and operate more efficiently.She is exiting the municipal bond business and pulling back from consumer banking in various parts of the world, with plans to exit 14 consumer franchises in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico.Story continuesShe is also cutting jobs and reorganizing business lines as part of an internal restructuring that Fraser has called the ""most consequential"" change to how Citigroup operates in nearly two decades.Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo, a longtime critic of the bank during its more challenging years, has made Citi its top bank stock pick for 2024.

Yahoo Finance,The SEC just approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Here's what investors should know.,2024-01-10,0.555556,"The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday granted approval to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, backed by Wall Street, a key regulatory step expected to drive significant investment in the digital currency.The agency gave the green light to multiple financial firms to offer spot bitcoin ETFs, including asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Franklin Templeton that cater to retail investors. Until now, only bitcoin futures ETFs had SEC approval. Bitcoin prices have shot up on the SEC's approval of the ETFs, more than doubling since last year, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index
shows.
Prices for the cryptocurrency had already risen 61% since October on expectations that the SEC planned to grant approval of spot ETF applications, CoinDesk
reported.Here's what to know about spot bitcoin ETFs.What's an ETF?ETFs are pooled investments, like a mutual fund, but that trade on stock exchanges like a stock or bond and that track a specific index, sector or asset class.A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.

Yahoo Finance,SEC ends crypto drama by giving the green light to 11 bitcoin ETFs,2024-01-10,0.222222,"The moment the crypto world wanted finally happened Wednesday. And this time it was for real.Regulators on Wednesday gave money managers the green light to launch 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, allowing everyday investors to get exposure to the worlds largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.The ETFs, which begin trading Thursday, could make bitcoin a potential staple in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans and give it mainstream acceptance.The Securities and Exchange Commission made the announcement roughly 24 hours after a fake social media post claimed those approvals had already been granted.The chaos triggered by that unauthorized post on X reverberated from Wall Street to Washington while attracting new scrutiny to the SEC, a longtime foe of the industry that is still in the middle of a widespread crackdown on some of cryptos major players.The price of bitcoin seesawed Tuesday and Wednesday as investors tried to make sense of the mishap, which erased tens of billions in market value in just minutes.SEC Chair Gary Gensler made it clear in a statement Wednesday that his agency ""did not approve or endorse bitcoin"" when it signed off on the new products and called Wednesday's announcement ""the most sustainable path forward"" following a key court defeat on this issue last summer.""Investors should remain cautious about the myriad risks associated with bitcoin and products whose value is tied to crypto,"" he said in his statement.Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. (Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS)
(REUTERS / Reuters)One SEC commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw, published a dissenting opinion that called the agency's actions ""unsound and ahistorical.""""I am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of US households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets,"" she said in her statement.The SEC has rejected such applications in the past, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation.Story continuesThe list of applicants approved by the SEC Wednesday included some of the biggest names on Wall Street, from BlackRock (
BLK
) to Franklin Templeton (
BEN
), as well as a number of firms better known in the crypto world.These issuers competed with one another in the run-up to their launches to offer the lowest fees, hoping to attract as many investors as possible once ETFs begin trading.Other big Wall Street players plan to be part of the action, as well. JPMorgan Chase (

) and Goldman Sachs (

(Lucas Jackson/REUTERS)
(REUTERS / Reuters)Since then, the SEC has denied more than 30 similar applications.A key turnaround moment came last year in June when the worlds biggest money manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The interest from one of Wall Streets biggest names sparked other asset managers to follow suit.Another important development came last August when one of the ETF applicants, Grayscale Investments, won a key legal victory over the SEC. Grayscale had sued the SEC in 2022 after it wasn't allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (
GBTC
) into a spot bitcoin offering.Its core argument was that the agency had already approved exchange-traded products that held bitcoin futures contracts and thus had ""acted arbitrarily and capriciously.""A three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington sided with Grayscale, saying the firm had ""advanced substantial evidence"" its product was similar to bitcoin futures ETFs previously approved by the SEC.That forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscales spot bitcoin ETF application, along with others filed by rival money managers.""We are now faced with a new set of filings similar to those we have disapproved in the past,"" Gensler said in his statement Wednesday. ""Circumstances, however, have changed.""One of the applicants, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, told Yahoo Finance that the dominant providers of spot bitcoin ETFs will be those that take in the most money from investors right out of the gate.The winners ""will be a few and it will be the most liquid,"" she said.Cathie Wood, ARK Investment Management's CEO. (David Swanson/REUTERS)
(REUTERS / Reuters)Historically, launches for other bitcoin products have sent bitcoins price on a wild ride.It happened in 2017 with the launch of the countrys first bitcoin futures contracts and then in 2021 with the SECs approval of the first bitcoin futures ETFs. Prices soared and then fell by large amounts in the year following the launches.In recent weeks, much debate has raged over whether bitcoin will rise or fall once the lauded moment of approval comes to pass.Gautam Chhugani, managing director of the research arm for Bernstein, said his team estimates such financial products will garner $10 billion or more in investment flows through the end of 2024 and ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" over a two-year period.That, he added, will help push bitcoins price even higher.""We do think that bitcoin goes to $150,000 by 2025,"" Chhugani added.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.Click here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

laid off 10% of its staff
after hasty pandemic hiring followed by an economic downturn.""Our job is to grow the company and to continue to achieve great margins,"" Benioff told Bloomberg in an interview at the time. ""We know we have to hire thousands of people.""Layoffs and pauses seem to be making an unfortunate comeback in the new year. The announcement of Salesforce and Slack's hiring pause coincides with significant reductions in

laid off 4 percent of employees this week
in a cost-cutting measure.Story continuesThis freeze comes as a surprise to some, especially
after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff extended job offers
to OpenAI employees in November, promising to match their current salaries after the temporary removal of OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman.""The good news is that we've made a ton of hires over the last six months.

This subtle growth suggests that demand and supply are finally balanced.Intel's Open House at the Consumer Electronic Show on Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. (Jeff Bottari/AP Images for Intel)
(ASSOCIATED PRESS)But Kitagawa warned that balance might be short-lived as economic and geopolitical volatility could upend the PC markets return to growth. While the PC market picked up in Q4, the global market is still fraught with pockets of weakness. In particular China has proven to be stubbornly slow to recover.Overall, Gartner said Greater China pulled down results for the Asia Pacific region, which saw shipments decline as much as 8%. The EMEA region saw the biggest jump in growth, with shipments rising 8.7%. North America shipments also increased.The turnaround, however slight, comes at an important time for the PC industry, as Microsoft, chipmakers, and PC manufacturers push the concept of the AI PC as the next major growth opportunity for laptop and desktop PCs.AI PCs are loosely defined as PCs outfitted with some kind of neural processor capable of running AI programs natively. Nvidia (

) also says PCs running its graphics chips and cards are AI PCs, since AI programs run better on that kind of hardware.Microsoft (
MSFT
) in particular is keen on adding AI capabilities to consumers devices, with the launch of its AI-powered Windows Copilot on Windows systems and the inclusion of a Copilot key on Windows laptop and desktop keyboards.Story continuesSign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.
(Yahoo Finance)Industry watchers largely expect 2024 to serve as a kind of rebound period for the PC industry as the laptops and desktops consumers and businesses purchased at the onset of the pandemic in 2020 begin to age out of usefulness. As the world began to shut down, millions set out to purchase PCs to be able to work and play while on lockdown.As a result, sales of PCs fell off of a cliff as consumers and businesses had little reason to upgrade in the intervening years. But as those systems begin to become outdated, demand is picking up again.That will help a litany of companies outside of PC makers, including chip manufacturers, memory makers, and other component builders. Intel (
INTC
), AMD (

Investing.com,2023 Corporate Bankruptcies Topped Pandemic Year Numbers,2024-01-11,0.222222,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
There were more corporate bankruptcies in 2023 than there were during the pandemic of 2020.
Higher interest rates and massive levels of corporate debt drove the flurry of business failures last year.
There were 642 corporate bankruptcy filings in the U.S. in 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. That was a 72.6 percent increase over the 2022 total and the largest number of bankruptcy filings since 2010.What caused the big surge in bankruptcies in 2023?
You can blame the Federal Reserve.
Simply put, the U.S. economy cannot function long-term in a high interest rate environment. Easy money is gone and companies are struggling to survive without that mothers milk.
The central bank drove interest rates from zero to 5.5 percent in a relatively short period of time to fight price inflation. But the real problems started long before the rate hiking cycle.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed pushed dropped interest rates to zero and held them there for nearly a decade. It didnt start trying to normalize rates in earnest until 2017, and it failed miserably. In the fall of 2018, the economy started getting wobbly and the stock market crashed. The Fed paused rate hikes in December 2018 and cut rates three times the following year. The pandemic gave the central bank the excuse it needed to slash rates back to zero in 2020.
Other central banks followed the Feds lead. More than a decade of easy money had a predictable effect. Corporations, governments, and individuals ran up mountains of debt."

Investing.com,US CPI Bounce Goes Unheard; Focus Shifts to Bank Earnings,2024-01-12,0.333333,"Yesterdays US inflation report wasnt exactly ideal. The headline inflation rose more than expected to 3.4% from 3.1% printed a month earlier. Shelter, electricity, and food prices drove the overall CPI index higher in December. Especially, the shelter costs increased by more than 6%. But if you dont count food and energy price inflation, core inflation eased to 3.9% during the same month. And well, if you start getting the shelter cost off the calculation, the numbers were quite good. Of course, the metrics that disregard food, energy, and shelter prices  like the core and supercore inflation  make little sense to Mr. and Ms. Everyone, as everyone eats, everyone uses energy and everyone needs shelter. Yet, for the Federal Reserve (Fed), these items have volatile prices, so they prefer looking past these important categories. While doing so, inflation eased. Also, note that a rise in car prices also added to the inflationary pressures last month. But their weight is lower in the calculation of the PCE index. Thats why the Feds favorite inflation gauge  the PCE index which will be released by the end of the month - will likely be trending closer to the 2% target.But all in all, yesterdays inflation report was less than ideal, and the market reaction was mixed. The US
2-year
and
10-year
first rose then fell, whereas you would expect a swift shift in dovish Fed expectations following a bigger-than-expected jump in US headline inflation. The equities were up and down, and the
S&P 500
closed the session very slightly in the negative while the
Nasdaq
eked out even a small gain at yesterdays close.Disinflation remains the base case scenario for this year, housing costs are expected to fall  at some point  and that could counterweight the rising shipping costs caused by the Red Sea tensions and low water levels in the Panama Canal that also threaten food deflation that we saw last year. Yet some hawkish voices are rising at the Fed, at the start of this year. Feds Loretta Mester said that its probably too early to cut rates. Mr. Barkin also repeated that hes looking for more evidence that inflation is headed toward the 2% target.But its obvious that investors are not willing to trade the bad smell for now.The
US Dollar Index
is under pressure after yet a stronger-than-expected inflation report, the
EUR/USD
rebounded lower after hitting the 1.10 mark, as the euro bulls, or the
dollar
bears found no reasonable conviction to carry the rally above the 1.10 mark, and gold rebounded after hitting the 50-DMA, near $2013 per ounce. Activity on Fed funds futures still gives more than 70% chance for the first Fed rate hike to happen in March. But the Fed wont find enough evidence that inflation will ease toward the 2% target as early as March. Consequently, there should be a readjustment in market expectations, and we will see the stock and bond prices make a corrective move to the downside.Over the next few weeks, attention will be directed toward company earnings, and we will start digesting the earnings starting from the financial sector. The SPDRs financials closed last year with more than a 20% rally thanks to optimism that the Fed would start cutting the interest rates sooner rather than later. The massive rebound in US long-term papers had a substantial positive impact on their balance sheets. Yet expectations for the US banks are not necessarily positive. First, the banks are expected to announce a 21% decline in their profits compared to the same period last year, as a result of higher costs to attract and maintain deposits in an environment of high inflation and higher Fed rates. Then, credit card delinquencies continue to rise. US consumer spending remained robust yet people are not buying stuff that they can afford. The bad loans are therefore expected to be on the rise. On the corporate side, investment banking revenues will likely remain weak given that the M&A activity was subdued last year. And well, if the Fed starts cutting the interest rates and the economy slows, the banks will start seeing their net profit margin shrink. Therefore, the FactSet projections indicate that the S&P 500s financial sector could reveal the4th highest yoy earnings decline among all 11 sectors for Q4, with an estimated downturn of -3.1%. If thats the case, a correction in the S&P 500 financials would only make sense after a more than 20% rally recorded in just two months. Anyway, I stop here and let the bank earnings tell the story.In energy,
crude oil
rebounded 2% yesterday and is better bid this morning on the back of rising tensions in the Red Sea. This time the news that Iran captured an oil tanker off the coast of Oman is pushing prices higher. Yet the Red Sea tensions have so far been insufficient to push the price of a barrel sustainably higher. Therefore, price rallies into and above the $75pb level could be interesting top-selling opportunities for those willing to see the price of a barrel fall below the $70pb level.On the corporate level, consolidation in the US energy sector is now shifting toward the nat gas companies.

Investing.com,EUR/USD  US CPI No Game-Changer for Interest Rate Expectations,2024-01-12,0.666667,"The CPI report has become a source of good news for investors, as inflation has fallen sharply to within touching distance of the Federal Reserves 2% target. The last step may be the hardest, as many have warned, but investors are clearly of the view that the hard work has been done and its only a matter of time until rates are falling.Todays report was not expected to be a game-changer, with forecasts pointing to only marginal moves in December and thats exactly what we got. Unfortunately, the surprises came in the wrong direction which is whats knocked sentiment in early trade on Wall Street.Ultimately, it doesnt really change anything and interest rate expectations are broadly as they were. Theres plenty more to come between now and March that will dictate whether that meeting is as live as markets are currently positioned for.Jobless claims were no more inspiring, barely changed from a week ago, and marginally lower than expected. Continuing claims were slightly lower but the trend remains as it was. Layoffs are low but the trend in continuing claims is higher, suggesting few are losing their jobs but those that are, are struggling to find new work. Perhaps not the weakness the Fed expected to see but maybe enough to get inflation back to 2%.Before the release,
EUR/USD
was flirting with 1.10 again and, in part due to the release, it failed to break above here before trading lower on the day.Source  OANDAWhile this could be viewed as a bearish signal, the recent trend remains bullish since the October lows and the rebound off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level last week supported this. Another failure at 1.10 may weaken that position but only a break below 1.0882 would suggest the trend has changed.Original Post"

Investing.com,"Despite Higher-Than-Expected CPI, Trend of Easing Inflation Persists",2024-01-11,0.555556,"In December, the
consumer price index
(CPI) in the United States rose by 3.4% year-over-year (YoY), marking the highest increase in three months, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).As expected, the hotter-than-expected print led to a cautious response in the financial markets.The concern stems from the CPI climbing more than expected in December, prompting speculation that the Federal Reserve might maintain its hawkish interest-rate stance for a longer duration than previously anticipated.In December, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.3% month-over-month (MoM), surpassing the median estimate of 0.2% from 68 economists, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg.On a year-over-year basis, the CPI rose by 3.4%, exceeding the estimated 3.2%. The core CPI, excluding food and energy, also rose by 0.3% MoM, meeting expectations. On a YoY basis, the core CPI increased by 3.9%, slightly higher than the estimated 3.8%.Notable changes include a 0.2% increase in the food index, a 0.4% increase in the energy index, and a 0.5% rise in the shelter index. Owners' equivalent rent of residence increased by 0.5% in December, contributing to a 6.3% year-over-year increase.According to BLS, the shelter index experienced a continued rise, contributing to more than half of the overall monthly increase in all items. The energy index increase was driven by higher electricity and gasoline indexes, offsetting a decline in the
natural gas
index.The food index increase mirrored the previous month. Food at home increased by 0.1%, while food away from home rose by 0.3%. The index for all items, excluding food and energy, also rose by 0.3% in December, matching the previous month's increase.Categories such as shelter, motor vehicle insurance, and medical care showed increases, while household furnishings and operations, along with personal care, decreased. The energy index decreased by 2% over the 12 months ending December, while the food index increased by 2.7% over the same period.A separate press release from BLS showed that real average hourly earnings for all employees saw a 0.2% increase in December. This growth is attributed to a 0.4% rise in average hourly earnings, coupled with a 0.3% increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.However, real average weekly earnings experienced a 0.2% decline during the same period, driven by the change in real average hourly earnings and a 0.3% reduction in the average workweek. On a yearly basis, from December 2022 to December 2023, real average hourly earnings witnessed a 0.8% increase, seasonally adjusted.The change in real average hourly earnings, combined with a 0.3% decrease in the average workweek, contributed to a 0.5% growth in real average weekly earnings over this twelve-month period.Thursdays CPI report came in slightly higher than anticipated, fueling bets that the Federal Reserve may not start cutting rates until at least May this year. However, it is noteworthy that the trend of easing inflation persists, supported by several leading indicators pointing towards softness.Unemployment claims remain low, reflecting subdued temporary seasonal hiring in November and December. These data releases imply a potential temporary increase in Treasury yields and inflation expectations, while a more prolonged move could definitely hurt
stocks
.Futures traders maintained a significant likelihood of the Fed initiating interest rate cuts in March. The CME Group's FedWatch gauge indicated a 63% probability of a reduction in March, slightly down from the previous day. This probability underscores a divergence in expectations between the market and the Fed regarding the timing and extent of rate cuts in 2024.The investment banking giant UBS said earlier this week that it expects the Fed to cut rates by 100 basis points this year.Inflation strengthened as 2023 concluded, with the CPI rising 0.3% in December from the previous month and 3.4% from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department. This marks an acceleration from November's 0.1% monthly gain and 3.1% annual increase. Thursdays print has fueled uncertainty surrounding the Feds next moves with the central banks officials now likely to push back against expected rate cuts in March.***Shane Neagle is the EIC of The Tokenist.

Yahoo Finance,"Rental giant Hertz dumps EVs, including Teslas, for gas cars",2024-01-11,0.666667,"By Nathan Gomes and Joseph White(Reuters) -Rental firm Hertz Global Holdings is selling about 20,000 electric vehicles, including Teslas, from its U.S. fleet about two years after a deal with the automaker to offer its vehicles for rent, in another sign that EV demand has cooled.Hertz will instead opt for gas-powered vehicles, it said on Thursday, citing higher expenses related to collision and damage for EVs even though it had aimed to convert 25% of its fleet to electric by 2024 end.CEO Stephen Scherr had last year at the JPMorgan Auto Conference flagged headwinds from higher expenses for its EVs, particularly Teslas.Hertz even limited the torque and speed on the EVs and offered it to experienced users on the platform to make them easier to adapt after certain users had front-end collisions, he said.Shares of the company, which also operates vehicles from Swedish EV maker Polestar among others, fell about 4%. Tesla's stock was down about 3%.Hertz also expects about $245 million in charges related to depreciation expenses from the EV sale in the fourth quarter of 2023.BUMPY ROAD FOR EV GROWTHIts decision underscores the bumpy road EVs have hit as their sales growth slows, causing carmakers like General Motors and Ford to scale back production plans.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note Hertz's move was another sign that EV expectations need to be ""reset downward"".While consumers enjoy the driving experience and fuel savings (per mile) of an EV, Jonas said there are other ""hidden costs to EV ownership"".""Expenses related to collision and damage, primarily associated with EVs, remained high in the quarter,"" Hertz said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.The company, which had earlier planned to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by 2022 end and 65,000 units from Polestar over five years, said it would focus on improving profitability for the rest of its EV fleet.German rental car company Sixt said in December it had not purchased Tesla vehicles since 2022 and was selling its fleet of Teslas ""as part of our regular de-fleeting process"".Story continuesIt still plans to offer a range of electrified vehicles and ""stick to our goal to electrify 70-90 percent of our rental fleet in Europe by 2030"", it said on Thursday.USED-EV PRICES DROPMeanwhile, wholesale used-EV prices fell for most of 2023 as prices for new EVs fell and inventories of unsold electric vehicles rose, according to Cox Automotive data.Cox forecast before Hertz's decision that used-EV prices would decline more than overall used vehicle prices in 2024.""While 20,000 cars isn't a large number in the total used vehicle market, it does mean Hertz will be taking a major loss on each of these sales while further contributing to the trend of falling used EV values,"" iSeeCars.com analyst Karl Brauer said.Hertz is selling some Tesla Model 3 for as low as about $20,000, nearly half the purchase price for the cheapest variant of the compact sedan, its used car website showed.It lists more than 700 EVs on sale, including BMW's i3, Chevrolet's Bolt and Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y SUVs.(Reporting by Nathan Gomes and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, Joe White in Detroit; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar, Sriraj Kalluvila and Arun Koyyur)"

Yahoo Finance,Amazon layoffs show Big Tech is still coming down from pandemic highs,2024-01-11,0.222222,"The COVID-era spending spree is over. And the tech layoffs keep coming.Amazon (
AMZN
) is eliminating several hundred roles across
Prime Video and MGM Studios
, according to a memo sent to staff on Wednesday. And the company's video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, announced it is
laying off more than 500 people
.That Amazon is ringing in the new year with
another round of cuts
highlights the tech sector's climb down from COVID-era expansion. Even as confidence grows on Wall Street that the economy will finally break free from fears of a recession, tech companies are still
reeling from heady staffing days
and
ambitious investments
made during the early stages of the pandemic.During the acute phase of the public health crisis, company ranks swelled alongside aspirations of rapid growth and a tech-centric transformation. Many executives and market observers believed new consumer habits would redefine the trends to come and accelerate changes already on the way. Screen time exploded as social lives shrunk and adapted. But the spike in demand for e-commerce and digital services eventually leveled off, leaving executives with what they claimed were bloated teams and inefficiency. A brutal wave of job cuts was their answer.""A lot of companies in various sectors of the economy had rapid expansion during the 'stay at home economy,'"" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. ""Amazon is taking steps to narrow the gap between employee headcount and the growth of its business.""Amazon was arguably the darling of the pandemic era as it benefited from consumers sudden shift to online shopping and businesses broad move to the cloud, said Nicole Tanenbaum, partner and chief investment strategist at Chequers Financial Management. During this period, Amazons profitability soared while the company boosted staffing and leaned into expanded offerings and markets. Amazons headcount grew by 310,000 from
2020
to
2021
, an increase of almost 25%.Story continuesBut as the disruptions of the pandemic eased into a recovering economy,
the companys prior investment decisions collided with slowing revenue growth, a reset in consumer spending patterns, and increasing cost pressures triggered by historic inflation.Amazon also faced a major leadership transition. Jeff Bezos, the companys founder, whose identity is intimately tied to the company, stepped aside as CEO in 2021. Andy Jassy, the head of Amazons lucrative and industry-leading cloud service, AWS, then took the reins.Not only does Jassy take a much more direct approach with regards to regulatory and political issues, he has not been afraid to admit that the company overbuilt and needed to reset its approach, lasering in on efforts to control margins and operations in the face of significant inflationary pressures, Tanenbaum said.Amazon is cutting several hundred positions across its Prime Video and MGM Studios unit. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)
(ASSOCIATED PRESS)For Jassy and Amazon, rightsizing the business arrived in the form of substantial cost-cutting initiatives. The company enacted stark headcount reductions along with a hiring freeze to further control costs.Amazon's layoffs over the last several years amount to more than 27,000 cuts. The latest round underscores the financial pullback, especially in contrast to massive spending during peak COVID. For instance,
Amazon spent $8.5 billion to acquire MGM, the home of James Bond, in 2022. And the company is estimated to have doled out
more than $1 billion to produce multiple seasons of
The Rings of Power
,
its
Lord of the Rings
prequel series, and likely the most expensive show ever.While Amazon is among the largest private employers in the US, and the biggest within the tech world, several of its industry peers have turned to drastic layoffs. Meta (
META
) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, dubbed 2023 the ""
year of efficiency
."" The social media company cut more than 20,000 jobs since late 2022 to cope with declining ad revenue and to improve the business and its cost structure.And Google (
GOOG
,
GOOGL
), which has cut more than 10,000 jobs in that period, said
on Thursday it is laying off hundreds of workers
on its digital assistant, hardware, and engineering teams, as the search giant aims to trim costs and focus on its biggest priorities.There is a chance Big Tech will bolster its ranks if the Fed starts to cut rates later this year, relaxing the more reserved posture the industry has adopted. But whats happening now to staff levels suggests otherwise, said Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. After peaking in the spring of 2022, tech industry headcounts suffered a significant decline through the summer of last year. Those losses eventually flattened out and leveled off, a trend thats likely to continue, as exuberance gives way to caution.The digital lives of consumers changed during the pandemic  that's undeniable. But they continue to change, along with the next chapter of the US economy.Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy. Follow Hamza on Twitter

The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which converted into an ETF, saw about $2.3 billion in volume, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meantime, BlackRocks iShares Bitcoin TrustIBIT saw over $1 billion change hands.This is definitely ground-breaking, said Athanasios Psarofagis, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. There was no doubt demand would be strong for these ETFs, but the numbers across the board are impressive.Still, its hard to compare Thursdays activity to any other day in ETF history. Typically, only one fund that tracks a new asset class begins trading on a single day. Its unprecedented to see over 10 nearly identical funds all begin at once. But even singling in on one ETF indicates the sheer magnitude of trading.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust was the most heavily traded ETF debut on record. To be sure, the product has existed in its trust structure since 2013, and had a nearly $27 billion headstart in asset size.Trading volume doesnt indicate buying or selling or investor inflows. Because of the way the funds settle trades, net flows into or out of the products probably wont be known until at least Friday.When the initial Bitcoin futures fund began trading in 2021, it saw turnover of almost $1 billion during the entire first day. At the time, the futures fund debut was the second-most heavily traded fund on record.Story continuesPsarofagis added a caveat that much of the demand may be from so called seed money that is pre-arranged by the fund issuers.

But excluding volatile food and energy costs the pace of price increases fell to 3.9% from 4%, showing ongoing moderation in underlying price pressures.It was an ambiguous outcome at a time when Fed officials are looking for some final but convincing bits of evidence that the pandemic-era spike in inflation has dissipated to the degree they can begin easing monetary policy and begin reducing the benchmark interest rate.The December CPI report ""just shows there is more work to do and that work is going to take restrictive monetary policy,"" Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.""I think we need to see more evidence,"" before reducing interest rates, she said, with a March rate cut, currently anticipated by financial markets, ""too early in my estimation.""In separate comments to reporters following a presentation at the Virginia Bankers Association, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the December inflation report was ""about as expected,"" with prices rising slowly for goods but shelter and services costs still increasing at a more vigorous pace.Barkin said that did not add to the sort of ""conviction"" about future declines in inflation that he feels he would need to begin reducing the Fed's target interest rate.""This gap between services and shelter and goods is one that I am watching carefully because you would not want a goods deflationary cycle to end and find yourself disproportionately bearing the cost of shelter and services,"" Barkin said.Story continuesWhile noting the progress the Fed has seen in inflation this year, with some measures close to the central bank's 2% target over the past six months, ""you'd have even more reassurance...if it were broader based"" and included a slower pace of price increases for services and housing costs, Barkin said.The Fed is expected to hold its policy rate steady at the upcoming Jan. 30-31 meeting, but financial markets anticipate rate cuts will begin in March.(Reporting by Howard Schneider and Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

Investing.com,Biden Admin. Runs Half Trillion Dollar Deficit in Q1 of Fiscal 2024,2024-01-12,0.222222,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Just one quarter into fiscal 2024, the federal government has already run a budget deficit of over half a trillion dollars.
The December budget shortfall came in at $129.37 billion, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That drove the 2024 deficit to $509.94 billion. Thats a 21 percent increase over the first quarter deficit in fiscal 2023.
This follows on the heels of the third-largest annual budget deficit in history (1.7 trillion).
These massive monthly budget shortfalls are pushing the national debt higher at a dizzying pace. On December 29, the national debt eclipsed $34 trillion for the first time. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5, the national debt stood at a ""mere"" $31.46 trillion.President Joe Biden blames Republican tax cuts under the Trump administration for the ever-widening budget deficit, but the numbers dont bear this out. Federal receipts were just under $1.1 trillion in the first quarter. Thats 12 percent higher than through the first three months of fiscal 2023.
Federal revenue did decline in fiscal 2023 after a windfall in 2022. According to a Tax Foundation analysis of Congressional Budget Office data, federal tax collections were up 21 percent in fiscal 22. Tax collections also came in at a multi-decade high of 19.6 percent as a share of GDP. But at the time, CBO analysts warned the good times wouldnt last.
And they didnt.
Government receipts fell by 9.3 percent in fiscal 2023. Even so, receipts are up so far this year even as the deficit climbed.
The real problem is on the spending side of the ledger. Over the last two years, the Biden administration has blown through roughly half a trillion every single month.
Through the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the federal government spent $1.62 trillion. Thats a 12 percent increase over the first three months of last year.Excessive borrowing and spending is a bipartisan sport.
This underscores the fact that the fundamental issue isnt that the U.S. government doesnt have enough money. The fundamental problem is that the U.S. government spends too much money. Despite the pretend spending cuts, and promises from the Biden administration that it would save hundreds of billions the debt ceiling deal (aka the [misnamed]
Fiscal Responsibility Act
) didnt address that problem. No matter what you hear about spending cuts, the federal government always finds new reasons to spend more money.These big budget deficits are happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills, and it is likely one of the reasons that the Federal Reserve is talking about rate cuts even though the CPI remains well above the mythical 2 percent target. The borrow-and-spend U.S. government cant function in a high interest-rate environment.
Uncle Sam spent $288.01 billion in interest expense to finance the national debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. That was more than national defense ($238 billion) and more than Medicare ($168 billion). The only higher spending category was Social Security at $351 billion.
Net interest expense, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, was $216 billion in Q1, still nearly as much as the government spent on national defense.
Much of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month, some of that super-low-yielding paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates. The weighted average interest rate on the governments outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.17 percent as of the end of December. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.32 percent in December 2022.
Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words, the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
And it's only going to get worse.
Interest expense will continue to rise at a rapid rate as more and more Treasuries mature and are replaced by higher-yielding bonds.
The only way out of this fiscal death spiral is significant spending cuts and/or major tax hikes. Congress doesnt seem to have the political will for either."
Investing.com,The Common Definition of Inflation Is Wrong - It's Just Government Propaganda,2024-01-12,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
The Consumer Price Index for December came in hotter than expected but its a lot lower than it was a year ago. That means inflation is decreasing, right?
Not so fast.
Its important to understand that the term inflation as bandied about by government people and the mainstream financial media is vague and imprecise. The word simply means an increase. But an increase in what?When government officials and pundits on TV talk about inflation, they almost always mean price inflation. This is what the CPI attempts to measure  how much prices have generally gone up in the economy. When you hear Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell or some other government official talk about cooling inflation, theyre simply saying that prices are not rising as fast as measured by the CPI.
But historically, inflation didnt mean rising prices. Inflation was defined more precisely as an increase in the amount of money and credit in the economy, or more succinctly, an expansion in the money supply.Economist Ludwig von Mises defined it this way in his essay ""

Investing.com,Gold Rises Despite Strong US CPI Numbers; EUR/USD Briefly Touches a 10-Day High,2024-01-12,0.333333,"The gold (XAU) price gained 0.23% in a very volatile trading session on Thursday.Initially,
XAU/USD
dropped to a 1-month low as US inflation figures were higher than the forecast. However, the pair regained most of the losses during the late American trading session due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Gold traders need to take geopolitical risks into consideration. Even though the fundamental pressure on gold turned more bearish due to higher-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, the news from the Middle East about the US launching military strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen pushed XAU/USD up.The market now worries that the Federal Reserve (Fed) won't deliver a first-rate cut at the March monetary policy meeting. Indeed, Fed officials remain hawkish. For example, Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester said it would likely be too soon to cut the base rate in March. Richmond Fed chief Tom Barkin added that gains on inflation have been too narrowly focused on goods. Therefore, it seems unreasonable to expect the price of gold to increase. However, political instability in the Middle East increases gold's safe-haven appeal and supports the bullish trend in XAU/USD.Gold was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions as the US and the U.K. launched military strikes against locations linked to the Houthi movement in Yemen. Today, XAU/USD may remain volatile as traders attempt to balance between bearish fundamental data and bullish geopolitical news.

Investing.com,Decline in Full-Time Jobs Points to Rising Recession Threat,2024-01-12,0.333333,"In the most recent BLS employment report, the percentage of full-time jobs relative to the population dropped sharply.The robust headline number of 216,000 led most media commentators to suggest a
soft landing
is at hand. However, the decline in full-time employment suggests recession risks are higher than thought.To understand why such is the case, we must first review why the current economic environment remains stronger than anticipated.In mid-2023, we
discussed
how the massive monetary infusions supported economic activity, and we were experiencing a
manufacturing
recession but not an economic one.Much like in 2011-2012, the manufacturing side of the economy has been in contraction for over a year, as shown by the
ISM Manufacturing
Index.The reason such was possible is that the service sector of the U.S. economy kept the economy afloat. Unlike in the past, where manufacturing was a significant component of economic activity, today, services comprise nearly 80% of each dollar spent.This isnt the first time we have seen the manufacturing side of the economy contract, but services remained robust enough to keep the overall economy out of recession. The economy similarly avoided a 
recession
in 1998, 2011, and 2015.Lets build a composite index and economically weigh services and manufacturing to the current environment. We can more clearly see why the economy has avoided a recession.So, what does that have to do with full-time jobs?With high inflation and interest rates, how has the services side of the economy held up so well? That was a function of a tremendous amount of fiscal liquidity poured into the economy.However, as shown above, service growth has slowed as those
excess savings
ran out. In the future, wage growth and employment will be the supporting factors for economic activity, which is critical to understand.The U.S. is a consumption-based economy. However, consumers can not consume without producing something first. Production must come first to generate the income needed for that consumption. The cycle is displayed below.Of course, if you bypass the production phase of the cycle by sending checks directly to households, you will get a strong surge in economic growth.As shown in the
GDP
chart above, the massive spike in economic growth in the second quarter of 2021 directly resulted from those fiscal policies.However, once individuals spent that stimulus, the economic activity subsided as the production side of the equation was still lagging. Here is the crucial point about full-time jobs.While the media touts the strong employment reports, such is mostly the recovery of jobs lost during the economic shutdown. As shown, full-time employment as a percentage of the working-age population failed to recover to pre-pandemic levels.There are two crucial points in this data. First, the economy has NOT created millions of
new
jobs, as touted by the current administration.Secondly, relative to the working-age population, full-time jobs dropped dramatically, generally seen at the onset of recessions. Combine that with the decline in wage growth, and the potential stress on the service sector becomes more apparent.As the economy slows down, it should not be surprising that full-time jobs are declining.To protect earnings and profitability, cutting full-time jobs, the most significant expense to any business is the most efficient.While employers tend to hang on to employees as long as possible, employees eventually get sacrificed when protecting profits. As such, a reasonably predictable cycle continues until exhaustion is reached.With CEO confidence currently at levels usually associated with recession, it should be unsurprising that full-time jobs are declining.Such is particularly the case with the surge of foreign-born workers pouring into the U.S.That large pool of workers, who tend to work longer hours for less pay than native-born workers, gives companies an alternative hiring source to replace full-time with part-time workers.The alternatives for higher-skilled workers include swapping full-time employees for technological improvements, artificial intelligence, and robotics to reduce costs.As we discussed in this
article
, when faced with threats to profitability, companies will opt to reduce head counts. This was a point made in a previous report by the
Congressional Budget Office"
Investing.com,"Can We Expect More Geopolitical Turmoil, Rising Commodity Prices?",2024-01-12,0.666667,"Over the past few hundred years there has been a relationship between the extent of global military conflict and secular trends in commodity prices, with secular upward trends in commodity prices coinciding with increases in both the frequency and amplitude of military conflict. Weve covered this topic in the past, but not recently (the most recent discussion was in 2017). Due to what has happened over the past two years, this is a good time for a revisit.In his book War Cycles Peace Cycles, Richard Kelly Hoskins discussed the aforementioned relationship and presented a chart similar to the one displayed below. The chart depicts the secular trends in commodity prices over the past 260 years. Hoskins explained that most of the important military conflicts occurred during the up phases on the chart, and therefore referred to the secular commodity-price uptrends as war cycles. The secular commodity-price downtrends were termed peace cycles.A plausible explanation for why long-term advances in commodity prices are accompanied by a general increase in military conflict is that war leads to more monetary inflation, government spending, and government intervention in the economy, as well as large-scale resource wastage and supply disruptions  the perfect recipe for higher commodity prices. In addition, when structures get destroyed by war, the commodities that are embedded in these structures are destroyed and eventually get replaced as part of a rebuilding process, causing a large temporary increase in commodity demand. There is also a feedback mechanism whereby military conflict and the associated monetary inflation bring about higher commodity prices, while higher commodity prices add to international tensions and increase the probability of military conflict.A new war cycle began with the secular low for commodity prices in 1999 and has been marked, to date, by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, the nebulous War on Terror, the Arab Spring uprisings, the overthrow of Libyas government, the rise of the Islamic State organization, an initial increase in tensions between the West and Russia in 2008 related to the expansion of NATO (in particular, talk of adding Ukraine and Georgia to NATO) and culminating in the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, a long and devastating war in Yemen involving Yemeni factions and Saudi Arabia, a war in Syria, Chinas provocative expansion in the South China Sea, a further increase in tensions between the West and Russia leading to Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Israel-Hamas war that began in October-2023 and the recent Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea.At this stage, the current war cycle has lasted about 25 years, while the average length of a war cycle during the period covered by the above chart is 33 years. Therefore, the historical record indicates that if the current cycle is close to the average length then we can look forward to another 8 years or so of rising commodity prices and increasing geopolitical conflict."

In fact, only a small percentage of the bottom 20% of households have enough income to get a tax cut under the proposal, the researchers from Penn concluded.But those at the very top of the income ladder also wouldn't see significant tax savings if the bill becomes law. Not only does the higher deduction phase out for incomes of $200,000 or more (or $400,000 for married couples), but a larger proportion of high-income households use
itemized deductions
.""The poorest fifth of Americans would receive just 2% of the benefits of this provision, and on average, that means a tax break of just $30 next year,"" said Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the committee's ranking Democrat.Story continuesThe change would also cost approximately $96 billion over 10 years, the Penn researchers found.The standard deduction for 2023 will be $13,850 for singles and $27,700 for couples. The deduction nearly doubled as part of the 2017
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
, which expires in 2026. An increasing number of taxpayers have opted to claim the standard deduction, rather than itemize deductions for
mortgage
interest, charitable donations, medical costs and a host of other deductible expenses. According to the IRS, 90% of taxpayers opted for the standard deduction for their 2021 taxes.Will it Help Ease Inflation or Make it Worse?Temporary Tax Plan Could Boost Your Standard Deduction By Up to $4,000Sponsors of the temporary increase said the measure was intended to provide relief from
inflation
, which soared to 9.1% last June before dropping to 4% in May. The target inflation rate for the Federal Reserve is 2%, which mirrors the historical average.That reasoning was criticized in an analysis by the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, which pointed out that increasing the disposable income of so many Americans tends to make inflation worse, and would contradict efforts by the Federal Reserve to slow consumer spending by raising interest rates.Bottom LineAn increase in the standard deduction on federal income tax would benefit most U.S. households but only a small amount of lower-income taxpayers would see any cut to their tax bills. Since the increase of the standard deduction in 2017, fewer taxpayers have been itemizing deductions on their returns.Tax Optimization TipsWhen it comes to saving and investing for
retirement
, taxes are a significant and complicated consideration. Saving in a
traditional IRA
or
401(k)
gives you an immediate tax break since contributions are made on a pre-tax basis. A
Roth account
, on the other hand, is funded with after-tax dollars so your money grows tax-free. Here's some additional guidance for

.Using internal data and an Employee Benefit Research Institute database, JPMorgan Chase studied 31,000 people as they approached and entered retirement between 2013 and 2018.

Meanwhile, 80% of retirees still had not reached RMD age were yet to take distributions from their accounts, the study found, suggesting a desire to preserve capital for later in retirement.Retirees prudence surrounding withdrawals may be misguided, though.The RMD approach has some clear shortcomings, JPMorgan Chases Katherine Roy and Kelly Hahn wrote. It does not generate income that supports retirees declining spending in todays dollars, a behavior that we see occurs with age. In fact, the RMD approach tends to generate more income later in retirement and can even leave a sizable account balance at age 100.What Are RMDs?Retirees who limit retirement account withdrawals to RMDs could be making a mistake, according to JPMorgan Chase.An RMD is the minimum amount the government requires most retirees withdraw from their tax-advantaged retirement accounts at a certain age.

REUTERS/Jason ReedBill Gross has warned investors to tread carefully in today's treacherous market.
The billionaire ""Bond King"" said they shouldn't cash out but should avoid the riskiest assets.
Gross argued that asset values increasingly reflect ""new fundamentals"" like Fed policy and momentum.Investors should exercise caution in today's perilous market, Bill Gross has warned.A century ago, a company's stock price was largely determined by hard numbers such as its book value or cash flows, the billionaire cofounder of Pimco wrote in an

Yahoo Finance,I Have $2 Million Invested With My Financial Advisor and Pay a 1% Fee. Am I Paying Too Much?,2024-01-12,0.666667,"Paying a 1% annual fee to a financial advisor
for managing a $2 million investment portfolio is pretty typical, but that doesnt necessarily mean its the right amount for every investor. Even small-sounding financial advisor fees can seriously erode long-term returns when compounded over years or decades. A 1% annual fee on a $2 million portfolio earning 7% could cost you more than $375,000 over 10 years. You may be able to get better performance by choosing a less costly advisor or otherwise finding a lower fee rate. The key is to identify specific services you are receiving in exchange for those fees and carefully evaluate whether your portfolios performance and advisor relationship justify the costs from a mathematical and personal perspective.Do you have questions about retirement planning, tax planning or investing?
Speak with a financial advisor today
.Understanding Financial Advisor FeesAccording to a 2021 study by Advisory HQ
, the average financial advisor fee is 1.02% for $1 million in
assets under management (AUM)
as an annual fee. Advisors and firms all have their own fee schedules, though, so these can vary. This type of fee usually covers investment management, portfolio monitoring and performance reporting services, hence why theyre usually based on asset tiers. For things like financial planning and other services, hourly and fixed fees are more common, though percentage-based fees can still apply.Advisors with more years of experience, advanced expertise or special certifications like
certified financial planner (CFP)
can sometimes charge higher fees. The exact fee percentage can also typically differ depending on the overall account size and specific mix of services provided.For example, an advisor may offer a tiered fee schedule where the percentage rate decreases as asset amounts rise. In other words, on the first $1 million in a portfolio, the annual fee may be 1.2%, while assets above $2 million are charged at a rate of just 0.8%. This structure allows firms to serve clients across the wealth spectrum, while still being incentivized to help those clients continue accumulating assets.Story continuesSome advisors also customize service offerings and related fees to match a clients needs. An advisor may charge a lower percentage fee, but exclude financial planning and instead focus narrowly on
investment management
. Others may set up a comprehensive service bundle that includes financial planning, tax preparation,
estate planning
review, insurance analysis and other, more specialized offerings. In those cases, the fee paid may be higher but aims to encompass full-scope financial guidance rather than just investment portfolio oversight.Why Fees Matter Over the Long TermWhile a 1% annual fee may seem like a small price to pay for professional investment guidance and financial planning, it can significantly erode portfolio returns over long time horizons. Even seemingly minor differences in fees add up in a big way when compounded year after year for decades.Below is an example of how various financial advisor fee tiers can affect the ending value of a $2 million portfolio with a 7% average annual return over 10 years. This can illustrate that even small changes in financial advisor fees can make a substantial difference in returns over long time horizons. For context, without any fees taken out of the above $2 million portfolio, it would grow to $3,934,303 at that rate and time horizon.Annual Advisory Fee Rate

-$719,692Finding a Fee Rate That Works for YouPaying higher financial advisor fees does not guarantee receiving better investment performance or service. On the flip side, nor does paying lower financial advisor fees mean you'll automatically receive higher overall returns. If you manage your portfolio without professional help, youll save on fees but wont have access to the services that a financial advisor can provide.If you want professional aid from a financial advisor
, focus first on paying a reasonable fee for the scope of services you think you require. This also involves avoiding paying for services you aren't likely to use. For instance, maybe you have a strong retirement plan and dont need financial planning services into your retirement years. However, be sure to clearly understand exactly what personalized offerings are included in exchange for the fees paid and
negotiate
respectfully if you feel costs seem misaligned or outweigh the benefits.On the flip side, you could investigate lower-cost options like
robo-advisors
if your situation demands fairly simple, automated portfolio management rather than holistic financial and investment planning. As with most major financial decisions, take the time to thoroughly weigh all pros, cons and alternatives before committing to either choice, though. And remember to review your fee arrangements periodically to ensure they continue meeting your evolving needs over time.Bottom LineA 1% annual fee on a multi-million-dollar investment portfolio is roughly typical of the fees charged by many financial advisors. But thats not inherently a good or bad thing, but rather should hold weight in your decision about whether to use an advisors services. Additionally, carefully determine what specific services you realistically need and receive in exchange for fees paid.Tips for Finding a Financial AdvisorFinding a financial advisor

Citi to Cut 20,000 Roles in Frasers Bid to Boost ReturnsThere seems to be of lot of selling of Grayscale, Scaramucci said during a Bloomberg Television interview on Friday.The hedge fund manager said that his trading desk noted that holders of the shares, which were converted from a trust this week when the US Securities and Exchange Commission signed off on the ETFs, were selling to book losses and shifting to lower fee alternatives.Selling one Bitcoin product to buy another should not impact Bitcoins price, said Zach Pandl, Grayscales managing director or research. The potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a topic of conversation since Grayscales court victory last summer. Following the sharp run-up in Bitcoins valuations, its natural to see some profit taking in the asset, he said.GBTC, which has existed since 2013, posted $2.3 billion in volume on Thursday, the largest first-day turnover ever for an ETF. It has been one of the most popular channels to gain exposure to Bitcoin. On Thursday, the original cryptocurrency broke through $49,000, hitting a two-year high. It fell below $43,000 on Friday.Shares of GBTC fell 5.2% to $38.58 on Friday. They surged more than 300% last year, compared with an increase of almost 160% for Bitcoin.The second thing we are seeing is the bankruptcy estate of FTX is unloading into the ETF announcement, Scaramucci said. There is a heavy volume of selling in Bitcoin right now. I do expect the supply overhang to be done in the next six to eight trading days.Story continuesFTX, which was one of the largest crypto exchanges, filed for bankruptcy in 2022 along with a flurry of major crypto companies amid a market crash. It still holds large amounts of crypto assets and is in the process of unwinding.One last thing, there has been a quiet period for the Wall Street. Wall Street has not been able to market these ETFs and that will start in about eight days as well, Scaramucci said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerbergs Top Priority

Citi to Cut 20,000 Roles in Frasers Bid to Boost ReturnsNet charge-offs at Bank of America and Wells Fargo rose during the fourth quarter partly due to office loans, according to earnings releases Friday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. set aside more reserves because of a deteriorating outlook on commercial-property valuations, the bank reported Friday.Banks have been grappling with fallout from climbing office vacancies in the aftermath of the pandemic and financing costs that have soared as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates.

Bank of America has about $7.6 billion of office loans maturing in 2024, and $3.1 billion in 2025, according to a presentation. While about 75% of its office loans are backed by higher-quality buildings, its percentage of non-performing office loans ticked up during the fourth quarter.At Wells Fargo, non-accrual loans for offices totaled $3.4 billion at the end of December, up from $2.8 billion at the end of September and $186 million a year ago.

), Google (
GOOG
,
GOOGL
), and Meta (
META
). Until now.The Justice Department is reportedly in the final stages of deciding whether to wage a sweeping legal attack on Apple that could compound headwinds already picking up steam for the world's most valuable company in a rough start to the new year.According to
the New York Times, US antitrust investigators are wrapping up a two-year probe into Apples closely guarded ecosystem. Investigators are looking into whether the integration between the companys suite of products  including iPhones, the App Store, Apple Watch, iMessage, and AirTags  blocks competition.""You don't ramp up unless you find that there's something significant there that you want to investigate,"" adjunct Columbia University Law School professor
Martin Edel
said about the reported probe. The multiyear probe, he said, tends to serve as a harbinger that the department found something it wants to pursue.Still, he cautioned, it's possible that the DOJ's investigation doesn't turn up any wrongdoing on Apple's part.Threatening the 'walled garden'Apple's antitrust worries come as the company faces a trio of downgrades from Wall Street analysts amid fears of weak demand for iPhones in China as that country's economy continues to sputter. On Friday Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable publicly traded company at the close of the trading day.Apple is also preparing to launch its most ambitious product yet, the Vision Pro spatial computer. The AR/VR headset, which goes on sale Feb. 2, is Apple's first new device category since it launched the Apple Watch in 2015 and could serve as the company's successor to the iPhone.But the AR/VR market is still incredibly small compared to the smartphone space, and consumers have tended to tire of the devices after a few months of use.Story continuesA DOJ lawsuit seeking to dismantle Apples ""walled garden"" ecosystem would pose a major threat to the company's various revenue streams. Apple generates the bulk of its cash through the sale of its wildly popular iPhone, which accounted for $200.6 billion of the company's $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023.But Apple's services and hardware that tie into the iPhone are also incredibly lucrative. The company's wearables, home, and accessories business, which includes its Apple Watch and AirPods sales, generated $39.8 billion last year, while its growing services business, which includes subscriptions for things like Apple Music+ and App Store sales, brought in $85.2 billion.Edel said he expects any DOJ antitrust action against Apple to look at how the company maintains its dominant position in a particular market where it holds an alleged monopoly, and not how it established prominent market position.The iPhone 15 Pro is presented during the ""Wonderlust"" event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. (Loren Elliott/REUTERS/File Photo)
(REUTERS / Reuters)Apple may be particularly vulnerable to a government-led antitrust challenge in the final months of the Biden administration, which has kept up an aggressive push to reign in Big Tech.""The department has been fairly aggressive after companies that it thinks has maintained a monopoly position through illegal means,"" Edel said.University of Miami School of Law professor John Newman told Yahoo Finance that while no antitrust case is easy, and monopolization cases are among the hardest, the DOJ brings a lot of strengths to the table.For one, he said, prosecutors can gain access to company documents and data before filing a complaint.""If I were Apple, Id be pretty worried about this,"" Newman said, adding that the DOJ has some of the worlds top antitrust litigators in-house.The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after its unveiling on June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File)
(ASSOCIATED PRESS)Critics say that Apple abuses its market position in a number of ways, including by charging app developers a 15% to 30% fee on app store sales.The company has also been accused of locking out competitors from using Apple services like Find My and the tech giant's payment technology.Interoperability between Apple and third-party services is also a sticking point, as app developers and hardware makers accuse Apple of purposely cutting off access to certain features that Apple's devices and services can use.The Epic effectThere are currently two separate antitrust cases that could impact how the DOJ approaches claims against Apple.One is a federal antitrust case heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in October. Justice Department lawyers were permitted to present arguments in a high-stakes dispute between popular app developer Epic Games and Apple.In that case, the appeals court upheld a

""DOJ may want to stay out of the Ninth Circuit altogether and write on a clean slate.""Google's battleThe second case that could that could impact how the DOJ approaches Apple is a pending antitrust suit against Google over its dominance of the search engine market.Closing arguments for the case are scheduled to take place in March. Apple plays into the conversation because in 2021 Google paid mobile phone manufactures, including Apple, a combined $26 billion to serve as their default search engines.The lion's share of those payments went to Apple. Analysts at Bernstein say the figure likely nets Apple between $18 billion and $20 billion per year. At $20 billion, the payments would represent somewhere between 5.5% and 7% of Apple's annual revenue over the last three years.If the DOJ's investigation of Apple is in fact near its end, Edel said talks are probably already underway between its attorneys and Apple.Those talks and negotiations, he said, could potentially also resolve any DOJ competition concerns without the need for litigation.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

All the market research said US consumers like really big cars.But when Thuy visited the US to meet with dealers in September and showed off the smaller VF3, she said they urged her to compete on the lower end of the market.Everybody said, 'definitely, its going to be the biggest volume for us,' Thuy said.

Biden Says US Doesnt Support Taiwan Independence After Vote
Nvidias Red-Hot 2024 Start a Bright Spot as S&P 500 Eyes RecordCongressional negotiators are locked in talks over renewing expired business tax breaks and boosting the child tax credit, evenly split between both. The proposal will need to pass through a Congress that is deeply divided over the nations fiscal trajectory, as some Republican lawmakers push for deep spending cuts as a condition for averting another government shutdown on Jan. 19 and Feb. 2, when temporary funding expires.If passed, the tax breaks offer a double-edged sword for an economy that appears on course for a soft landing.While the extra cash would boost consumer spending, it would also risk reigniting inflation pressures  complicating prospects for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates this year, economists warned. Data for December show that inflation picked up at the end of 2023, fueled by services costs while a decline in goods prices petered out. The consumer price index increased 3.4% in the year through December, the most in three months. Prices for clothing and cars continue to increase.Mickey Levy, a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, said the tax measures would add fuel to an economy that is already growing faster than estimates for its long run potential. The legacy of pandemic-era fiscal stimulus continues to juice growth, he said.Theres already substantial fiscal stimulus driving up economic activity, he said.Analysts say much will depend on the final details of any agreement and how the tax breaks will be structured. The draft deal would extend breaks through 2025.Story continuesThe talks were still in flux as lawmakers left for the long weekend Friday. After halting progress earlier in the week, several potential roadblocks to a bipartisan agreement emerged, including differences over the state-and-local tax deduction cap, an expansion to the low-income housing tax credit and a more robust child tax credit.If a deal does come together, money could start flowing to households as soon as March, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates for reducing deficits and debt. He cautions the proposal will do little to encourage additional corporate investment.Business BreaksThe proposed deal would revive tax breaks for research and development spending, boost the deductibility of investment, such as in equipment, and business loans. Lawmakers are discussing restricting benefits for foreign research investments in order to target the benefits to companies conducting such activities in the US.This is going to be a decent amount of fiscal cost with very little of it going to encourage new investment in a time when there are still inflation pressures, Goldwein said.Still, the plan could be a boon for President Joe Biden, whose poll numbers have slumped amid voter anxiety over the economy. Asked how the White House is weighing the potential inflationary impact of any proposal, Bidens top economic adviser instead emphasized benefits of the bill.We are very much hoping that we can see a balanced package, National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard said Thursday. But what is critical for the president is that the child tax credit be extended and particularly be made available for low and moderate income families, because it is so powerful in reducing child poverty.Child CreditThe child tax credit boost on the table as of last week wouldnt be nearly as much as the Covid-era version, which took the maximum credit from $2,000 to $3,600 per child. Its also not fully refundable for those without tax burdens, nor would it be paid monthly. Those details could change, as many Democrats vow to block the current deal.Nancy Vanden Houten, a lead economist at Oxford Economics, said the overall size of the tax package wouldnt be enough to derail her view that the Fed will cut rates in May.The impact on the broader economy would be relatively small, and probably not enough to change our forecast for inflation and the Fed, Houten said.At the very least, the tax negotiations underscore that lawmakers remain a long way from entering an era of austerity even amid warnings from ratings firms and investors that the US fiscal trajectory is unsustainable.Tax SeasonMoodys Investors Service in November warned it could downgrade the sovereign US rating because of wider budget deficits and political polarization. It lowered the outlook to negative from stable while affirming the grade at Aaa. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in August.If the tax proposal is agreed, negotiators are aiming for Congress to enact it before the Jan. 29 start of the annual tax-filing season.If it passes, it just becomes another shot in the arm for an economy that maybe does, or maybe doesnt, need it, said Owen Tedford, a senior research analyst at Beacon Policy Advisors LLC.--With assistance from Erik Wasson.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerbergs Top Priority

Yahoo Finance,The Nasdaq Will Likely Soar in 2024. 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Before It Does.,2024-01-14,0.555556,"As we embark on a new year, many investors are looking back at the stock market's performance over the past year and what it means for the future -- and there's plenty to be thankful for. After turning in its worst performance in more than a decade, the
Nasdaq Composite
returned to form, rising 43% in 2023.However, after an increase of that magnitude and the uncertainty that remains in the economy, investors are understandably asking themselves what to expect in 2024. Looking to history for insight about what could happen over the coming year reveals good news.The Nasdaq's first full year of trading was in 1972, and since that time, in every year following a
bear market
recovery, the tech-centric index has generated returns of 19% on average. The range of the results varies, from just 7% in 1986 to 38% in 2013. That said, based on the data, the chances are good that the Nasdaq will book gains in 2024.If the Nasdaq does soar in 2024, there are two tech stocks you'll want to have in your portfolio before it does.Image source"
Yahoo Finance,"Americans save $2,800 when moving from California to no-tax state, but there's more to the calculation",2024-01-14,0.666667,"Americans continue to chase affordability by moving to states with lower cost of living, and once again no-income tax states topped the chart for most in-bound migrations in 2023.The two largest US states without income taxes  Texas and Florida  grew by the most residents last year. Texas added 473,453 residents, and 365,205 people became Floridians between July 1, 2022 and July 1, 2023,
according to the US Census Bureau
. Meanwhile, two states with some of the highest state income tax rates in the country lost the most residents. New York lost 101,984 residents and California lost 75,423 in 2023, suggesting state
taxes play a large part in Americans moving decisions
.To be sure, a move from a high-tax state saves a chunk in income taxes. A California household earning the
median income of $91,905
would save nearly
$2,843 a year by moving from California
to a no-income-tax state. But theres more to the calculation, experts say, including property taxes, real estate prices  not to mention less-tangible quality of life measures.In other words, its a value proposition, not a simple equation.""When people compare shops, they don't always buy the cheapest thing  they go for value.

Yahoo Finance,3 Stocks to Buy Before the Fed Cuts Interest Rates in 2024,2024-01-14,0.555556,"The Federal Reserve
gave borrowers some good news last month. Not only did it elect to keep interest rates steady, but it also indicated cuts to the all-important federal funds rate. The median estimate calls for three rate cuts by the end of 2024.The federal funds rate is the rate at which banks lend each other money, and it's the biggest determinant of rates for just about every type of loan from a government bond to a home mortgage. The Federal Reserve is in charge of setting that rate, and by extension the cost to borrow for everyone from the government to consumers to businesses.While the Fed forecasts just three interest rate cuts, Wall Street is more optimistic. The average futures trader expects six rate cuts by the end of the year, bringing the top end of the Fed funds target rate from 5.5% to just 4%.Many businesses have been hit hard by high interest rates. But a few could see tremendous relief from lower costs to borrow that could fuel their earnings and, by extension, their stock prices much higher.

Yahoo Finance,PayPal Stock,2024-01-14,0.666667,"Tech has been the name of the game for the past year but not all tech stalwarts have enjoyed the market spoils. Take fintech giant
PayPal (PYPL)
, for instance. Over the past 12 months, the shares have shed 24% while the
S&P 500
has recorded gains of 20%.The drop has come as the company faces challenges in losing market share for its branded products, leading to a decline in both transaction percentage and transaction dollars.That has left Truist analyst Andrew Jeffrey frustrated, although the analyst remains in PayPals corner, despite conceding that many investors might need more convincing to get on board again. We are long-term bulls, based on attractive risk/reward, but acknowledge that PYPL could remain relatively range bound until branded volume and transaction $ stabilize, the 5-star analyst explained. That said, we still believe that PayPal still occupies an important position in the eCommerce ecosystem. This creates what we consider an asymmetric risk/ reward in which modest monetization and/or share gains could cause a disproportionate positive re-rating.For 2024 and 2025, Jeffrey anticipates modest yet noticeable growth in branded volume and transaction dollars. The forecast is tied to the companys initiatives aimed at transitioning from Braintree PSP (payment service provider) volume to branded solutions. That said, Jeffrey does admit that this is a tenuous forecast that relies solely on discussions with the company and anecdotal evidence that a more assertive Braintree pricing model and early efforts to enhance value-added services around its PSP offering could create a more favorable backdrop. We still need more evidence that this strategy is bearing fruit, and we recognize that Braintree price concessions could have their own adverse transaction % repercussions, the analyst went on to add.Nevertheless, Jeffrey states several reasons to back the PayPal case, including the view that eCommerce is a structural tailwind, and that even in the face of competitive challenges, PayPals two-sided network offers at least as much value to merchants as other wallets, like Apple Pay, and PSPs, like Stripe and Adyen. Moreover, the company generates plenty of FCF, and boasts a robust balance sheet. Lastly, absent material incremental fundamental deterioration, the stocks undemanding valuation suggests an attractive risk/reward.Story continuesAs such, Jeffrey maintained a Buy rating on the shares and raised the price target from $65 to $73, implying investors will pocket returns of 20% a year from now. (To watch Jeffreys track record,

)Views on PayPals prospects are split evenly on Wall Street with 15 Buys and Holds, each, resulting in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $71.35, the average target makes room for one-year returns of 17%. (

sell-the-news event
, one that analysts previously warned was possible given the tokens rapid price appreciation in the past months.Sell the news is a well-known term in capital markets and describes how asset prices, leverage and sentiment run-up in the lead-up to a bullish event, only for prices to tumble shortly after.BTC pulled back to as low as $41,500 early Monday, before recovering,
after briefly hitting its two-year high
above $49,000 as the first-ever spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. started trading last Thursday.The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. was much anticipated and well priced, so the event will likely be a short- to mid-term top for the price, analysts at Japan-based crypto exchange bitBank told CoinDesk in an email.Bitcoin could be vulnerable to profit-taking selling pressures in the short term, but given lower U.S. treasury yields and the markets optimistic outlook for the Feds early rate cuts, its downside risk may be limited, they added.bitBank said it considered the $40,000 psychological level as a support for bitcoin prices in the near term. Elsewhere, analysts at 10x Research, led by Markus Thielen, said in a
Monday note
that they expected prices to find support at as low as $38,000.Meanwhile, FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in a Monday email that a correction to at least $40,000 per bitcoin would be within bounds of typical corrections, given the cryptocurrencys price performance of over 150% over 2023.As such, long-term expectations for bitcoin remain largely bullish, given the apparent demand for ETFs, as volumes indicate, among institutional players.Bitcoin ETFs will be transformative for the industry, allowing for vastly greater access from traditional wealth management - their launch will bring new investment into bitcoin from pensions, endowments, insurance companies, sovereign wealth, retirement plans, trusts, and many more, shared Henry Robinson, founder at crypto fund Decimal Digital Group, in an email to CoinDesk.However, while the ETF launches are exciting, we think they offer no advantage over self-custody. For long-term holders, the fee emissions will bleed a position substantially. It may take many years, but we expect demand for ETFs to dwindle as bitcoin adoption rises and self-custody becomes more common among institutions, Robinson added."

In the weeks leading up to the date of approval, Wednesday, Jan. 10, bitcoin rallied to a recent high of ~$48,000.Many analysts and traders are now hoping the
upcoming bitcoin halving
 when the rate of new bitcoins issued to network validators (aka miners) is slashed  could be a similar catalyst for crypto prices. There is a longstanding debate whether these programmatically triggered events that occur once every four years are
priced in.The approval of bitcoin ETFs last week may give some indication of whats to come for the next bitcoin hype cycle.

Investing.com,The Ninja Price Increase - Shrinkflation,2024-01-16,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
You know all about price inflation and how it squeezes your wallet. But there are also ninja price increases out there that you might not notice. It's called ""shrinkflation.""
Inflation robs you of purchasing power by driving up the price of everything you buy. The government reports price inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) but it's a lot worse than they're telling you.
In the first place, the CPI is rigged to understate the extent of price inflation. You probably realize this every time you go to the store.
But price inflation also manifests itself in ways a government formula could never capture, and you may not even notice. Not only do you pay more for everything you buy, you get less.Literally.
And that's called shrinkflation.
Consumers aren't the only ones struggling with rising prices. Producers have to deal with them as well. The cost of materials, labor, and equipment go up, putting the squeeze on companies' bottom lines. Eventually, they have to pass those costs on to their customers.
But raising prices isn't a popular move. Ideally, a company would love to hide the price increase from you.
Enter shrinkflation.
Instead of raising the price, the company just gives you less for the same amount of money. It does this by shrinking packages or putting less stuff in the same size container.Shrinkflation doesnt show up in the CPI, and most of the time, you probably dont even notice. But the effect is the same as rising prices. You ultimately end up with less stuff.
It is stealth inflation.
Here's a recent example courtesy of Campbell's Soup.But as my friend astutely pointed out, it is ""part and parcel"" of a bigger picture and it reveals exactly what the government is doing to your money as a matter of policy.
The devaluation of the dollar manifests itself everywhere in ways we dont even expect or measure. The consumer price index measures inflation charitably by allowing, at their discretion, for the use of substitute goods and services to offset price increases. There are no aggregate metrics to account for the decrease in quality of goods, for shrinkflation, and the precipitous declines were experiencing in the quality and formerly personal nature of important services.
MousePrint.org chronicles shrinkflation. Here are some recent examples.Most of the time, consumers don't even notice shrinkflation. But when they do, they get mad. And their anger is usually directed at the greedy corporations that are charging them the same for less.
But there's another culprit.
The Federal Reserve.
Price inflation is a symptom of monetary inflation. As the central bank creates money out of thin air and injects it into the economy, prices generally rise. Economist Murray Rothbard noted that since governments have deemed paper tickets and ""computer digits"" money, then the government, as dominant money-supplier, becomes free to create money costlessly and at will. As a result, this inflation of the money supply destroys the value of the dollar or pound, drives up prices, cripples economic calculation, and hobbles and seriously damages the workings of the market economy.
Companies can't just ignore their cost problems. They can either raise prices, which will make you mad, or shrink package sizes, which will still make you mad, but you might not notice.
But the end result is always the same. You end up paying more and getting less."
Investing.com,The Transitory Inflation Myth,2024-01-16,0.666667,"The year-over-year growth rate of the US CPI was reported last Thursday to be 3.4%. This was 0.3% higher than the number reported for the preceding month and 0.2% higher than the average forecast, but the overall picture (refer to the chart below) is unchanged. The downward trend that began in June of 2022 is intact and we expect that the 2023 low will be breached during the first quarter of this year. However, the main purpose of this discussion is not to delve into the details of the latest CPI calculation but to debunk the persistent idea that the price inflation of 2020-2022 was mainly due to supply disruptions.The following chart shows the price of
natural gas
in Europe. This is an example of what happens when a supply disruption is the main cause of a large price rise. After the supply issue is resolved, the price falls back to near where it was prior to the disruption.By the way, there are many commodities that over the past few years experienced spectacular price rises due to disrupted supply followed by equally spectacular price declines. We could, for instance, make the same point using a price chart of
Oil
,
Wheat
or
Coal
.Its happening this way because the main driver of the inflation was a huge increase in the money supply combined with a huge increase in government deficit spending. In effect, all of the purchasing power loss that has occurred to date has been locked in and the best that people can expect from here is for their money to lose purchasing power at a reduced pace. In this respect the inflation is operating the same way as compound interest, except that instead of getting interest on interest people are experiencing cost-of-living increases on top of previous cost-of-living increases."
Investing.com,How the January Effect Has Evolved Over the Decades,2024-01-16,0.666667,"The January effect, named for the perceived market anomaly where stock returns in January are higher than in other months, has been a subject of interest since it was first written about in 1942.Traditionally, this effect has been attributed to tax-loss harvesting at the end of the year, where investors dump their laggards to offset capital gains taxes, leading to a December selloff. This is believed to be followed by a buying spree in January, as investors repurchase stocks, boosting demand and prices.Other explanations for the January effect include the influx of cash from year-end bonuses into the stock market, the rise of tax-sheltered retirement accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s, etc.) and the prevalence of new investment instruments and regulatory changes.Then theres also a perceived increase in investment activity as people follow through on New Years resolutions to invest more. January, after all, has long been associated with fresh starts and positive animal spirits. A recent YouGov poll found that about a third of American adults made New Years resolutions for 2024.The January effect may have been a pronounced trend in the past, but in more recent years, its delivered diminishing returns.Take a look at the visual below.

Meanwhile, Iran took responsibility for airstrikes near the US consulate in Iraq as a response to US attacks in Yemen.

Additionally, market expectations of the Federal Reserve (Fed) to begin cutting rates in Q1 have increased.

Investing.com,Central Banks Prioritize Inflation Fight Over Growth Concerns,2024-01-16,0.222222,"I sense that the first quarter of this year will be marked by the realization that its too early for the central banks to cut the interest rates unless something really bad  like another bank crisis, or a real estate crisis, or another debt crisis hits the fan.Because March  where market prices reflect the first rate cuts from both the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) - is about two months away, and things dont look *that* bad.In Europe, growth is slowing, Germany is struggling to reverse slow down, the slump in the Eurozones
industrial production
accelerated, and production fell 6.8% in November from a year earlier.Over the last 9 readings, only one came in positive, and it was a small 0.2% growth back in June. But the economic slowdown is what the ECB needs to pull inflation lower.And unless there is a sharp slowdown in economic activity, the ECB wont hurry up to cut rates. On the contrary, the bank is now focused on waning the pandemic-era aid programs.According to a recent Bloomberg survey, the ECB will make four 25bp cuts this year starting in June instead of six rate cuts starting from April  as priced in by the markets.In the US, the resilient growth, healthy jobs market, and sustained fiscal spending into the presidential election suggest no urge for a Fed cut in March.The divergence between the reason and market pricing suggests that the rate cut expectations will be gently delayed and pricing will be revisited.If thats the case, stock and bond markets should correct to the downside, and the
US dollar
should recover.The US dollar kicked off this week on a positive note, as the
EUR/USD
made a swift move to the downside following ECB Holzmanns words in Davos yesterday. Holzmann warned that the threats from looming inflation will likely prevent the ECB from lowering the rates this year, even as a recession can no longer be ruled out.He pointed at the conflict in the Middle East as a risk for further disruption to supply chains and energy markets and cautioned that the latter developments will likely keep the ECB alert regarding the price risks. The euro fell and the
Stoxx 600
retreated.One thing that prevents inflation worries from darkening the mood is the subdued reaction from oil markets. The escalation of the conflict in the Red Sea region no longer fuels oil prices. Despite news of further attacks and retaliation,
US crude
saw limited upside yesterday and closed the session slightly lower. Resistance remains intact into $75pb level.But if inflation worries resurface, weak economic data will no longer fuel the central bank doves and act as good news.The EUR/USD has the potential to fall further. The next natural target for the euro bears stands at 1.0875, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on the latest rebound that started in October. Below this level, the EUR/USD will step into the medium-term bearish consolidation zone.Cable could return below 1.25, and the
USD/JPY
could attempt to break the 100-DMA  near 147.40. But the consensus for the USD/JPY remains bearish as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) should exit the negative rate policy. Japanese policymakers could be further encouraged to act in case of strong annual wage-negotiation results."

Yahoo Finance,"US lawmakers reach $78 billion deal on tax breaks, but passage uncertain",2024-01-16,0.666667,"By Susan Heavey and David LawderWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The leaders of Congress tax-writing committees on Tuesday announced a nearly $80 billion bipartisan deal to enhance tax breaks for businesses and low-income families through 2025, but prospects for passage are unclear amid bitter fiscal divisions.The $78 billion package, agreed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, a Democrat, and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, a Republican, would temporarily expand the child tax credit and boost the low-income housing tax credit. It would restore business tax deductions for 100% of research and development expenses and capital expenditures for plant and equipment.The extensions would last until the end of 2025, aligning them with the expiration of personal tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017 and raising the stakes for tax policy differences in November's presidential election.The deal would increase the maximum ""refundable"" child tax credit -- the amount available as a cash payment -- by $200 per child to $1,800 for 2023, $1,900 for 2024 and $2,000 for 2025.Democrats have been trying to restore a much larger COVID-era expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child, which expired in 2021.Wyden said the plan would benefit 15 million children from low-income families while enabling the construction of more than 200,000 affordable housing units.SHORT TIMELINE, UNCLEAR PATHWyden said he and Smith want to pass the package quickly so that families and businesses can take advantage of the breaks as they file tax returns this year.

Yahoo Finance,Boeings board faces scrutiny yet again,2024-01-16,0.222222,"Good morning,Business pundits are
watching closely
to see whether CEO Dave Calhoun can lead Boeing through the aftermath of its latest crisis or if hell be replaced. But Boeings board also deserves scrutiny, according to Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors and a noted authority on corporate governance.In 2021, Boeings board famously paid
a hefty $246 million fine
to settle a shareholder
lawsuit
that accused it of failing in its fiduciary duty to monitor safety, and initially lying about
its response
to the first of
two fatal 737 Max 8
crashes. Now, as
investigations
continue into why a fuselage panel recently blew off a 737 Max 9mid-flight, Minow asserts that the board is a serial offender that doesnt learn from past mistakes.Its a bad board, and it has been a bad board for a long time, she tells
Fortune
.Part of the problem is that the board hasnt felt enough pressure to change, Minow explains. Boeing, as half of a duopoly, has only one major competitor, Airbus. It also holds government and commercial airline contracts that guarantee it business. Given the companys market dominance, the board has allowed Boeing to put financialnot aviationengineering first. The inevitable results were what we saw, says Minow, who owns Boeing shares.Others may criticize the company for not sufficiently overhauling its board and leadership immediately after the Max 8 fatalities. Four years ago, Calhouns predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, was fired, accused of leading a culture that put production
deadlines and profits
ahead of safety. But Calhoun, a veteran GE executive, had been the board's lead director overseeing Muilenburgs term and close ally to the prior chief executive who led the firm into the
rushed development
of the 737 Max 8.Meanwhile, Boeings current chair Larry Kellner has been a director since 2011 and previously led its audit committee.But will this fix what needs fixing? Jon Ostrower, editor-in-chief of The Air Current and former
Wall Street Journal
aerospace reporter, asked
in 2019
in response to the leadership revamp. Both Calhoun and Kellner had consistently blessed [Boeings] long-term strategy, he wrote.Story continuesHe wasnt the only one with misgivings. In 2020, proxy advisor Glass Lewis urged investors
to vote against
Kellner at the companys shareholder meeting, citing his role as audit committee chair during the 737 Max 8 crashes. Vanguard, Boeings top shareholder,
voted against
Kellner that year, referencing ""control failures"" by the audit committee. The following year, Glass Lewis advised against reelecting Kellner
a second time
.A handful of other board directors were also singled out by advisors, and consumer advocate Ralph Nader, whose grandniece died in the second Boeing 737 Max 8 crash,
called for
the whole board to resign.But during board shakeups, companies are expected to hang on to key people for the sake of continuity as they introduce new talent with fresh perspectives. After reviewing recent board changes at Boeing, Jo-Ellen Pozner, associate professor of management at Santa Clara Universitys Leavey School of Business, says she applauds the company for adding aviation and risk experts while replacing directors with financial, government, and trade expertise. If I were putting together a board for Boeing, this is what I would choose, she says of the current group. (More than half of the 13 current
board members
have joined since 2019.)Still, Pozner cautions that organizational culture is sticky. It takes time for transformational changes to trickle down from the board into a companys operations, and the newest directors on Boeings board are likely only hitting their stride about now. What happens over the next few weeks will reveal whether the board is indeed prepared for adversity and attuned to the right issues.Boeing didnt immediately respond to

Now their image could take another hit as rental giant Hertz dumps 20,000 of them, including Teslas, for gas-powered cars.Hertz, the largest U.S. fleet operator of EVs, has blamed the sale on high repair costs and weak demand for the vehicles it offers on rent.Analysts and industry experts believe the move will affect the second-hand market for EVs and dissuade buyers who are already rethinking big purchases due to higher borrowing costs.""The larger impact of Hertz EV fire sale is the perception hit to the technology,"" said Karl Brauer, analyst at used-car aggregator iSeeCars.com.""Mainstream consumers are already hesitant to buy an EV, and this news only supports their concerns.""The higher costs associated with repairing EVs stem from a lack of sufficient expertise in dealing with such vehicles and challenges in getting the replacement parts as they are still very new, industry experts said.Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr flagged elevated costs caused by damages to certain EVs, particularly Teslas, last year at a conference.Tesla and Polestar, whose cars are popular with car rental firms, did not respond to a request for comment. Car rental firm Avis and Enterprise also did not respond to a query on its EV strategy.CEO Scherr said Hertz limited the torque and speed on the EVs and offered them to more experienced users to ensure easier rides after certain renters had front-end collisions.Growing pains for startups and legacy automakers that are new to the technology also mean that EVs have been facing more problems than gas-powered cars, according to a survey last year by non-profit Consumer Reports.The survey, covering owner responses on more than 330,000 vehicles, showed that EVs from the past three years had 79% more problems than conventional cars.For many EVs, there is no way to repair or assess even slightly damaged battery packs after accidents, which forces insurance companies to write off the cars with a few miles - leading to higher premiums and undercutting gains from going electric.Story continuesGerman rental firm SIXT said on Tuesday it signed a multi-billion euro deal with Stellantis to buy up to a quarter of a million vehicles.The deal will also see Stellantis provide some EVs to the German mobility service provider, but the companies did not offer further details.Hertz' move underscores a wider shift in the EV landscape.After pledging billions of dollars for their EV ambitions in recent years, legacy automakers have pulled back their production plans as demand slows.EV sales growth in North America is expected to slow to about 27% this year from a scorching 72% in 2023, according to market research firm Canalys.CUT-PRICE SALEHertz may have to dispose of the EVs at hefty discounts due to the higher miles they have covered as well visible damage such as nicks, scratches and dents, according to experts.""Having rented several Model 3s from Hertz over the past six months, my observation is some of them are cosmetically pretty rough,"" said Scott Case, CEO of EV research firm Recurrent Auto.Nearly all of the more than 500 used EVs the company has on sale are Teslas, with some Model 3 compact sedans being listed for as little as $21,000 - half the price of a new car and up to $10,000 lower than cars of similar mileage at other sellers.Such a cut-price sale would likely reverberate across the second-hand market of EVs, which already command a lower price than conventional cars.The value of used EVs has dropped 33.7% between October 2022 and October 2023, even as the overall used car market dropped only 5.1%, according to data from iSeeCars.Hertz could, however, benefit from the $4,000 tax credit for some used EVs under the Inflation Reduction Act, which brings down the price of some vehicles it is trying to sell well below many gas-powered cars.Some experts also said the high repair costs of EVs are a short-term challenge that comes with any technology and will ease as more of those vehicles hit the road.""The infrastructure has to catch up with the transition, and that will bring the prices down,"" said Lynne McChristian, director of the Office of Risk Management and Insurance Research at the University of Illinois.(Reporting by Akash Sriram, Nathan Gomes in Bengaluru; Writing by Aditya Soni)"

Roth IRA contributions
due to the accounts associated income caps. In that case, you can instead consider a conversion, otherwise known as a ""backdoor Roth.""The advantage to doing this is that you will avoid all income taxes on withdrawals from the assets that you convert. The disadvantage is that this comes with a significant up-front tax bill, which is money you could have otherwise invested. However, if your goal is to
avoid taxes in retirement
, a Roth conversion can be an effective option.Do you have questions about managing taxes in retirement?
Speak with a financial advisor today
.What Is a Backdoor Roth IRA?A Roth IRA has two restrictions that don't apply to most other tax-advantaged retirement accounts.The first is a low contribution cap. As of 2024, individuals under 50 cannot contribute more than $7,000 per year to a Roth IRA, while that limit is $8,000 per year for those over 50. This is roughly one-third the
401(k) limit
, for instance.Roth IRAs also have income limits to contend with, though. More specifically, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA if your income exceeds $161,000 for single filers or $240,000 for joint filers. The IRS also steadily reduces your Roth IRA contribution limits at incomes between $146,000 and $161,000 for single taxpayers and $230,000 and $240,000 for joint filers.For high earners who want to take advantage of a Roth IRA's after-tax perks, these income caps are a problem. A potential solution is a Roth IRA conversion, otherwise known as a ""
backdoor Roth
.""With a conversion, you take assets in an existing pre-tax account, like a traditional IRA or 401(k), and transfer it to a Roth IRA in one lump sum. Since this is not considered a contribution, neither the income limits nor the contribution limits apply. You can convert as many assets as you would like, up to your entire pre-tax portfolio, and there is no limit on how many times you can convert funds.Story continuesIn the case of this situation, if you are an individual filer, then a $200,000 income puts you above the income caps for Roth contributions. That means a conversion is the only way you can put assets into a Roth IRA. But if you file jointly, you are below the income cap and can choose any combination of contributions and conversions.Advantages of a Roth ConversionThe benefits to a Roth conversion are already in the question posed for this article. This is one way to avoid/limit paying federal income taxes in retirement. With a
Roth IRA
, you pay taxes on your contributions, but not your withdrawals or investment growth. Since you will ideally withdraw far more from your portfolio than you will contribute, this should be a significant tax benefit down the road.Now, it's important to note that a Roth IRA does not protect you from state or local taxes as applicable. That said, those are generally quite small compared to federal income taxes. Even better, since Roth withdrawals do not count as taxable income, they do not apply to the calculation for Social Security benefits taxes.The result is that converting your retirement account to a Roth IRA will save you most, if not all, of your taxes in retirement. This is as opposed to a pre-tax account, like an IRA or a 401(k), where you do pay income tax on your withdrawals and that money does apply to your
Social Security
taxable income.Of course, this means you then cant take advantage of the income deduction benefits that pre-tax accounts offer as you contribute to them.Disadvantages of a Roth ConversionA Roth conversion comes with a large up-front tax bill.When you make a Roth conversion, the value of any assets that you convert are added to your tax bill for that year. So, for example, say you have $2 million in a 401(k) and convert the entire amount. This will save you taxes on your withdrawals, but you will owe
income taxes
on that $2 million in the tax year you complete the transfer.This can be a problem since it triggers taxes without the associated cash flow to pay the bill. This is why many people make large Roth conversions in stages, so that they only trigger that tax bill a little at a time. Note you also only pay taxes on that initial conversion. A significant advantage to a Roth conversion is that you will not pay taxes on any future growth in the account.This is the tradeoff with a Roth IRA. When you invest in a Roth account you pay taxes on the money you put in. This is money you could have invested, setting up the tradeoff of potential growth for guaranteed tax savings.Youll likely want to resolve this tension based on tax rates. If you expect that your tax rate in retirement will be higher than your current rate, or if you don't think you would invest the savings of a pre-tax account, then a Roth IRA could be worthwhile. If you expect to pay a lower tax rate in retirement compared with right now, then a
pre-tax account
could save you more money in the long run.Finally, any Roth IRA is subject to the IRS' pro-rata rule. This rule applies when you have both a pre-tax IRA and a post-tax Roth IRA. In that case you must take all withdrawals proportionally from both accounts. For example, say that you have $1 million in an IRA and $500,000 in a Roth IRA (a 2/1 ratio). If you withdraw $60,000 in a given year, you would have to take $40,000 from your traditional IRA and $20,000 from your Roth IRA (a 2/1 ratio). This can limit your flexibility when it comes to using this account.How to Set Up a Backdoor RothSetting up a Roth conversion depends on exactly how you would like to structure your tax payments, and on when you will need the money. When you make a Roth conversion you must leave the money in the account for at least five years, so plan for short-term cash flow in the meantime.To set this up, you will need a pre-tax account like an
IRA or a 401(k)
.You can then move your money a few different ways.The simplest option is a one-time, lump-sum transfer. In this case you move your entire portfolio into a Roth IRA. This can let you maximize your tax-free returns, but it can come with a steep up-front tax bill.Another option is to set up staged transfers. In this case you would convert your portfolio a portion at a time over multiple tax years. This lets you manage the tax bill triggered by each year's conversion(s), but it mitigates your tax-free returns.Finally, you can make ongoing or automatic conversions. You can do this with an IRA or with 401(k) plans that permit the option. In this case, you contribute money to a pre-tax account and leave it in place for any required holding period. Then transfer the account's assets to a Roth IRA, or you can set up an automatic transfer if your account allows this.Bottom LineAs an individual making $200,000 per year, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA if youre single, but can if youre married and file jointly. However you can convert funds from a pre-tax account into a Roth IRA through a process known as a ""backdoor Roth."" This will let you minimize federal income taxes in retirement at the cost of a large tax bill in the immediate.Roth IRA TipsA

That has raised concerns about the company's ability to repay its debt that is due to mature next year.The airline this month completed a series of sale and leaseback transactions covering dozens of planes in a bid to repay about $465 million of debt on those jets.But with a recovery in earnings not in sight, some analysts said the company might consider a bankruptcy filing to clean up its balance sheet and reorganize into a financially stronger airline.Helane Becker, airline analyst at TD Cowen, said Spirit is likely to look for another buyer, but that a more likely scenario is a Chapter 11 filing, followed by a liquidation. She said the recent capital raise has given the company funds to self-finance a potential Chapter 11 filing.""We recognize this sounds alarmist and harsh,"" Becker said. ""But the reality is we believe there are limited scenarios that enable Spirit to restructure.""The airline is expected to burn cash over the next several years and will have to continue to raise capital to survive, said Conor Cunningham, an analyst at Melius Research.""The path forward for Spirit turns to survivability,"" Cunningham said.Asked to comment, a Spirit spokesperson referred to the company's recent capital raise but did not elaborate. The company had no other immediate comment.The airline has been among the carriers hardest hit by a snag with RTX's Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines. It is the largest operator of GTF-powered aircraft in the United States.Story continuesAs a result, it had to ground a number of planes last year. The number of grounded planes is estimated to climb steadily in 2024, from 13 in January to 41 in December.Meanwhile, excess industry capacity in its key markets is hurting its pricing power, forcing the company to indulge in promotional activity with steep discounting to fill up its planes.After its third-quarter earnings last October, Florida-based Spirit said it was evaluating its growth profile as it faced softer demand.Analysts at Seaport Research Partners downgraded the company's shares after the court's ruling, citing ""the lack of a credible path to profitability.""Spirit's woes had led to a sell-off in its stock, raising worries about the impact on JetBlue's balance sheet after the merger. With Spirit's shares losing nearly half of their value since JetBlue won its takeover battle, some analysts wondered if that would prompt JetBlue to renegotiate the terms of the deal.Spirit's shares plunged 47% on Tuesday after the court's ruling, while JetBlue's shares gained about 5%.Another option would be to find a way to placate the Justice Department's competition concerns created by the JetBlue deal. The judge who presided over the case had at one point questioned whether further asset divestitures would allow the deal to pass muster. But a lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department said the only remedy was ""a full-stop injunction that would restore competition.""Analysts also raised the possibility that rival Frontier Airlines, which had lost out in a fierce bidding war, could again make a bid.Bill Franke, whose airline-focused private equity firm Indigo Partners owns 82% of Frontier, had not ruled out making a fresh bid for Spirit if the transaction with JetBlue failed to close. Frontier declined to comment.""Spirit has to figure out its Plan C,"" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of travel consultancy Atmosphere Research Group. ""Plan A was to merge with Frontier, Plan B became a merger with JetBlue.""(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; Editing by Chris Sanders and Matthew Lewis)"

Yahoo Finance,When will the Federal Reserve start to cut interest rates?,2024-01-16,0.222222,"The Federal Reserve ended 2023 with an unexpected pivot in policy.Central bankers signaled in December during their final meeting of the year that their nearly two-year battle against inflation has finally come to an end  and that a series of rate reductions are in the pipeline.Updated quarterly economic projections laid out after the meeting show that a majority of Federal Open Market Committee officials expect rates to fall to 4.6% by the end of 2024, suggesting that there will be at least three quarter-point rate cuts next year. Policymakers also penciled in additional rate cuts in 2025 and 2026.""We are seeing strong growth that appears to be moderating, we're seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures, and we're seeing inflation making real progress,""
Fed Chair Jerome Powell
told reporters last month. ""These are the things we've been wanting to see. We still have a ways to go. No one is declaring victory. That would be premature, and we can't be guaranteed of this progress.""FED'S FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION IS WEIGHING ON MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANSBut traders are betting on even more aggressive rate cuts, starting as early as March, despite a hotter-than-expected inflation report and recent efforts by Fed
policymakers to temper expectations

About 71.4% of investors are currently pricing in at least a quarter-point cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which tracks trading.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP""We entered 2023 worried about inflation and how many more times the Fed was going to raise rates,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. ""But we are ending 2023 surprised at how low inflation has come down  especially as unemployment has remained so low  and are wondering how many times the Fed will cut.""A FED PAUSE LIKELY WONT HELP STRUGGLING CONSUMERSGoldman Sachs economists are projecting the central bank will make a total of five interest rate cuts in 2024 as Fed policymakers successfully achieve a ""soft landing"" with gradually slowing economic growth.Story continues""The Fed will start cutting the funds rate soon, most likely in March,"" the strategists wrote. ""After all, Chair Powell said at the Dec. 13 press conference that the committee would want to cut 'well before' inflation falls to 2%. However, we expect 'only' five cuts this year, below the six-to-seven cuts now discounted in market pricing, and we view the chance of 50 basis points steps as low.""However, some economists believe the Fed will be slower to cut rates amid signs that the fight to bring inflation back to 2%  the central bank's target rate  will be longer and bumpier than expected. The Labor Department reported last week that the
consumer price index re-accelerated
in December due to an uptick in the cost of food, energy and rent.Bank of America and UBS are predicting four rate cuts this year, beginning in May, while Wells Fargo economists are penciling in just three reductions.401(K) HARDSHIP WITHDRAWALS ARE SURGING AS HIGH INFLATION SQUEEZES AMERICANSIf inflation continues to fall slower than expected, the Fed may move less aggressively to cut rates.""As long as inflation doesnt rebound and stay elevated, I believe the FOMC will be able to lower the target range for the federal funds rate this year,"" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said during a speech on Tuesday. ""When the time is right to begin lowering rates, I believe it can and should be lowered methodically and carefully.""Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference in Washington, D.C., on March 22.Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which then slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending. Higher rates helped push the average rate on 30-year mortgages above 8% earlier this year for the first time in decades.

S&P 500
dropping by 40 bps, as the VIX surged, rates rose, and the
dollar
strengthened.A good portion of the move came today after Fed governor Chris Waller pushed back against market-based expectations on rate hikes, which added to an already strong dollar and higher rates.The
10-year
rate increased by more than 11 bps, while the
2-year
rate increased by almost eight bps, which meant the 10/2 curve rose to -16 bps and is now back to its October levels.A further steepening of the yield curve is likely to happen. The next stop could see the yield curve move back into positive territory, which could come sooner, especially if the economic data continues to support an outlook with stagflation-like tilt.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 today was supported by the 4,750 level, which contained a lot of gamma, at least for today. The index briefly dipped below the 4,750 level but found immediate support and was able to rally the rest of the day.Today will be the

opex, and the hedging flows that have helped to suppress the VIX below 14 will be gone.The 14 level has been the upper bound since the beginning of the year, and that is because of the delta and gamma makeup of the options market. There is a lot of put delta at 14, likely serving as resistance.Today, the options flow that has kept the VIX below 14 will be greatly diminished, which could allow the VIX to start drifting higher, especially if the dollar continues to show strength and the yield curve steepens further.It is not a perfect fit, but the VIX index has been trading with a 10/2 curve.So, in general, what this seems to suggest is that a steeper yield curve over the short term is likely to result in higher implied volatility levels, and this fits in nicely, with the S&P 500 stalling out at the 4,800 due to options positioning and potential window of weakness, that may have started.Also, there is potential for large delta positions in mega-cap names like Meta (NASDAQ"
Investing.com,Plunge in NY Fed Manufacturing Index Shows Recession Monster Is Alive and Well,2024-01-17,0.333333,"The sharp drop in the New York Federal Reserves Empire State business-conditions index in January triggered a wave of warnings.Soon after this monthly survey data was released yesterday (Jan. 16), social media and beyond lit up, warning that this was a smoking gun for the US economys imminent descent into recession, assuming output hadnt already turned negative.But like most single-indicator releases, the crowd rushed to judgment and allowed the headlines du jour to overwhelm more thoughtful analysis.The
NY Fed Manufacturing Index
, as its popularly known, is prized as an early read each month on the manufacturing sector.The sight of this index dropping deep into negative terrain for January  the lowest reading since 2020, when the pandemic was raging  convinced some observers to warn that the jig is up and a US recession has arrived or is near.Maybe, but its hard to make a high-confidence call based on one indicator, much less one regional manufacturing indicator that draws on survey data from manufacturing executives in the NY Feds district.On that note, keep in mind that these same executives have become increasingly upbeat about the future (red line in the chart below).In fact, the NY Fed Manufacturing data is reaffirming old news. The manufacturing sector of the US overall has been in a slump for more than a year.The
ISM Manufacturing
Index in December marked the 14
th
straight month of contraction. A competing index reflects a similar condition.The question is whether manufacturing carries the same weight for analyzing the US business cycle relative to years earlier.Minds will differ, but theres no doubt that pre-pandemic assumptions about the recession signals have had a rough ride in the past few years as the economy has transitioned after an unusual and unprecedented run of macro activity and government intervention.Indeed, 2023 has been a
master class in reminding analysts
that the business cycle has evolved in surprising ways. Notably, the dark forecasts of a year ago turned out to be dead wrong.Theres no way to know for sure if an NBER-defined contraction is finally here, but there are productive and relatively reliable metrics to monitor that go well beyond cherry-picking a few indicators.Consider, for instance, another index designed by the New York Fed (and now updated by the Dallas Fed)"

Investing.com,Will Inflation Repeat the 1970s Rollercoaster?,2024-01-17,0.666667,"Appreciating Apollos graph below, comparing recent
inflation
to multiple bouts of inflation of the late 1960s, 70s, and early 80s is of utmost importance for investors.Sustained levels of high inflation are poor for stock and bond returns. Even more worrying, high inflation is insidious for the financial well-being and morale of the nations citizens. As divided as the country is today, sustained high inflation could worsen it.To properly assess whether a repeat of 70s-era inflation is possible, we must first understand why inflation was rampant during that period.With that knowledge, we can compare today with the prior episode to appreciate whether Apollos chart is a road map for the future or a spurious correlation.Due to the extreme importance of inflation on stock and bond market returns, we break this article into multiple pieces. Part One and Two discuss the causes and remedies of the inflation roller coaster spanning 1967 to 1982.Before exploring the inflationary environment of fifty years ago, it is worth pointing out that Apollos graph is misleading.First, the two vertical y-axis scales on Apollos graph are different. This makes it appear that the inflation rates of the 1970s and today are nearly identical.Second, the horizontal axis doesnt compare apples to apples. From 1960 to 1965 (not graphed), inflation fluctuated below 2% a year. In 1966, inflation started to increase consistently.In the modern time frame, the year 2020 is when the wheels for inflation were set into motion.Therefore, the recent data for comparison should start in 2020, not six years prior, when there was little inflationary impulse. The graph below adjusts both axes and provides a better comparison.While the graph above may dispel worrying similarities, what matters more is the comparison between the two economic environments.The Fed and government are primarily to blame for the 70s-era inflation. The Fed acknowledges its faults. To wit, the following paragraph from Michael Bryan, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.The painful inflation starting in the late 1960s was partly due to a prevailing post-Great Depression mindset. Notably, high levels of unemployment were unacceptable.To this end, the Employment Act of 1946 tried to coordinate monetary and fiscal policy 
to promote maximum employment
 along with a strong economy.As we will discuss later, The Federal Reserve Act of 1977 amended the Feds objectives to add stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates with maximum employment.However, before 1977, the Feds primary objective was low unemployment.
At the time, higher inflation levels, while not desired by the Fed, were an acceptable byproduct of meeting their employment objectives.To help set policy, the Fed put a lot of faith in the Phillips Curve. The theory claims that inflation and unemployment have a reliable and inverse relationship.The graph below shows the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment between 1960 and 1970. The Phillips curve proved very reliable during that period, further bolstering the Feds trust in the model.Like many economic models, the Phillips Curve does not account for human behavior and rational decision-making
.In this case, the Fed failed to consider that rational human behavior would cause the Phillips Curve to shift outward. The Fed didnt expect businesses and consumers expecting inflation to change their behaviors in ways that promote more inflation.For example, auto demand may increase because consumers rush to purchase new cars today instead of tomorrow in anticipation of higher prices. Similarly, auto manufacturers may increase prices today, anticipating metal prices will rise tomorrow.The following graph shows the once dependable Phillips Curve of the 1960s failed policymakers in the 1970s. Higher levels of inflation accompanied higher unemployment. With each peak higher in inflation, unemployment also reached new highs.Not only was the Fed relying on a faulty economic theory, but its ability to administer monetary policy was greatly amplified on August 15, 1971.The following comes from our article entitled The Fifteenth of August"

US dollar
and US Treasury yields rose, following hawkish comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) Governor Christopher Waller about the US interest rate path.Waller said that the US is close to achieving the Fed's inflation target of 2% but emphasized caution against early rate cuts until inflation is persistently low. The Fed is expected to maintain its policy rate at the 30  31 January meeting. However, the market forecasts a 61% chance of a rate decrease in March, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. 'Strong gains in the US dollar index are pressuring the gold market as well as a rise in US Treasury yields today on this first day back from the three-day holiday weekend,' mentioned Jim Wyckoff, the senior analyst at Kitco Metals. He also pointed out that 'one could argue that losses in gold are not bad compared to how strong the dollar is as tensions in the Middle East are keeping a floor under the prices.'

Investing.com,UK Inflation Unexpectedly Rises,2024-01-17,0.333333,"Yesterday was just another day where another policymaker pushed back on the exaggerated rate cut expectations. Federal Reserves (Fed) Christopher Waller said that the Fed should go methodically and carefully to hit the 2% inflation target, which according to him is within striking distance, but with economic activity and labor markets in good shape, he sees no reason to move as quicky or cut as rapidly as in the past, and as is suggested by the market pricing. So that was it. Another enlightening moment went down the markets throat in the form of a selloff in both equities and bonds. The
US 2-year
yield  which captures the rate expectations rebounded 12bp, the
10-year
yield jumped past the 4%, the
US Dollar Index
recovered to a month high and is testing the 200-DMA resistance to the upside this morning, while the
S&P 500
retreated 0.37%.Waller spoke from the US yesterday, but many counterparts are wining, dining, and speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, which doesnt only offer snowy and beautiful scenery this January, but also serves as a platform to many policymakers to bring the market back to reason. Expect more comments of this hawkish kind during this week. It turns out that one of the most popular topics of this years WEF is rising inflationary risks due to the heating tensions in the Red Sea which disrupt the global trade roads and explode the shipping costs.The European Central Bank (ECB) officials were the first ones to push back the rate cut expectations. They were the first ones to attract attention to the looming inflation risks and to the idea that the ECB doesnt consider cutting the rates despite the slowing economic activity and looming recession that would  in theory  justify rate cuts in the euro area way more than rate cuts in the States, where growth and jobs numbers remain surprisingly and non-alarmingly resilient.So many ask why the EUR/USD doesnt benefit from that hawkishness. Well, it did to some extent. The pair advanced past the 1.10 level at the end of last year. Yet, the reality is, even though the ECB starts cutting the rates after the Fed and cuts less than the Fed, the deterioration in the Eurozones economic fundamentals had already started counterweighing the hawkish ECB views. And now that the Fed members have started giving out a more hawkish voice to balance out the overly stretched Fed cut expectations, the downside correction in the EUR/USD is all but surprising. From a technical perspective, there is an important development in the EUR/USD. The pair slipped below 1.0875, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on the October to now rebound and is now in the medium-term bearish consolidation zone. There is potential for a deeper fall. The next natural targets for the bears are the 200-DMA, near 1.0845, and the 50% retracement, near 1.0793.Cable rebounded following an unexpected rebound in British inflation numbers this morning. Headline inflation unexpectedly rebounded to 4%, while core inflation remained steady at 5.1% versus the expectation of a decline below the 5% mark.This mornings inflation disappointment lead sterling bears to trim bets below the 1.26 mark.To give Rishi Sunak his due, inflation in Britain more than halved last year and is expected to return to the Bank of Englands (BoE) 2% target by spring, but the possibility of a U-turn in the inflation trend due to the geopolitical developments is a mounting risk and call for a balanced approach from the BoE.

Investing.com,Is the Subprime Auto Market Looking Fragile? I Believe So,2024-01-17,0.222222,"Last spring, I wrote about the fragility in the auto lending market.And since then, it appears that the auto market is showing increased signs of stress. Especially so for the subprime area.Thus, I believe its a good time to remember the
boiling frog
parable.In short, if a frog jumps into a pot of boiling water, itll immediately hop out. But if the frog jumps into a pot of semi-warm water, itll sit comfortably. But as the heat gradually increases to boiling levels, itll slowly cook until its too late to get out.This parable reminds us why humans react quickly to sudden events (jumping into boiling water). But fail to react to slowly changing conditions until it is too late (sitting in water as it gets warmer and warmer).So, what does this have to do with the auto market?Well, it may be something thats deteriorating slowly. And no one will notice until its too late (like the poor frog).To give you some context"
Investing.com,Gold,2024-01-17,0.555556,"I find it quite amusing that the market believes inflation is tied to rates  the propagandists at the Fed did their job there. Distract while creating bank reserves (print money) out of plain sight. The Monetary Base is up over 7% since March. M2 is also a bit higher. This is why the rate of inflation has been slowly rising again since June. Its also why
gold
is up 7% and
silver
is up 2% since the end of June (silver is up 15.9% since early March).The primary driver of my bull thesis is the shift in the Feds monetary policy. It was only a matter of time before this occurred. The Fed informally pivoted away from hiking rates at its November FOMC meeting. The markets immediately began to price several rate cuts in 2024 into stock valuations and bond yields.Follow the money  While most observers are watching what the Fed does with interest rates, few have noticed that the Fed stopped shrinking the money supply in response to the regional bank crisis in March 2023. In fact, the M2 measure of the money supply has actually increased slightly since April 2023 (while everyone merely glares at the YoY %-change in M2 that circulates social media). In addition, the Monetary Base, consisting of bank reserves and coin/currency in circulation, has increased over 7% since March 2023. This is the primary reason why the price of gold ran from $1,825 in March to $2,070 by year-end 2023.Money printing  much more so than changes in interest rates  is the fuel that drives precious metals prices higher.
While the economy is likely headed into a nasty recession this year (many sectors of the economy, like manufacturing, were already contracting during 2023), the primary factors that dictate Fed policy are the health of the banking system and the monetization of new Treasury bond issuance. Both factors will need to be addressed, in my opinion, with more money printing.Although the Feds dual mandate is to use its monetary policy to promote stable prices and full employment, its first priority is to prevent the too big to fail banks from collapsing. We saw this in 2008, again in 2020 and again in March 2023. In 2023, in response to the collapse of some big regional banks due outflow of checking and savings account funds from banks into money market funds, the Fed swiftly printed $400 billion and injected it into the banking system. In addition, it made available a QE-like facility called the Bank Term Funding Program which made funds  money created by the Fed  available to all banks.The $400 billion was removed by late June. But growth in the Monetary Base between March and the end of November (the most recent money supply report) shows that the Fed actually increased bank reserves by $410 billion. Very little of this is explained by the change in the level of currency/coin in circulation. This means that it used various back door liquidity facilities to replace the $400 billion it printed and then removed plus it added an additional $410 billion, of which only $147 billion is explained by the Bank Term Funding Program. In other words, the Fed is opaquely creating bank reserves (aka printing money) to address a burgeoning liquidity problem in the banking system.But the Fed will also have to help fund new Treasury bond issuance at some point this year. Over the next twelve months, an unprecedented $8.2 trillion in Treasury bonds will have to be refinanced. In addition, based on the first quarter of the Governments fiscal year (starting October 1, 2023), the Governments spending deficit on an annualized basis would be over $2 trillion. This is additional new debt issuance that will have to be funded  a task made more difficult by the fact that our Governments biggest foreign financiers (China, Japan, and OPEC) have been reducing their participation in Treasury auctions.Unless the Fed can find investors large enough to replace the missing foreign investment capital, it will either have to be the buyer of last resort or risk watching Treasury yields soar to a level that might induce foreign capital back to the table at Treasury bond auctions. Because considerably higher interest rates would throw the U.S. into an economic depression, the second motive for renewed money printing in 2024 will thus be a requirement for the Fed to bridge the gap between the supply and demand for Treasuries.I strongly believe that the financial and economic fundamentals are set up quite similarly, only much worse, to the conditions in 2008 that led to the Great Financial Crisis. As such, I also believe that the Feds response to the next full-blown financial system crisis will be much larger than its responses in 2008 and 2020. This should result in a cyclical bull move that I believe will be bigger than the move from late 2008 to mid-2011."

Yahoo Finance,Mother whose child died in TikTok challenge urges US court to revive lawsuit,2024-01-17,0.222222,"By Nate Raymond(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday wrestled with whether the video-based social media platform TikTok could be sued for causing a 10-year-old girl's death by promoting a deadly ""blackout challenge"" that encouraged people to choke themselves.Members of a three-judge panel of the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals noted during oral arguments that a key federal law typically shields internet companies like TikTok from lawsuits for content posted by users.But some judges questioned whether Congress in adopting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996 could have imagined the growth of platforms like TikTok that do not just host content but recommend it to users using complex algorithms.""I think we can all probably agree that this technology didn't exist in the mid-1990s, or didn't exist as widely deployed as it is now,"" U.S. Circuit Judge Paul Matey said.Tawainna Anderson sued TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance after her daughter Nylah in 2021 attempted the blackout challenge using a purse strap hung in her mother's closet. She lost consciousness, suffered severe injuries, and died five days later.Anderson's lawyer, Jeffrey Goodman, told the court that while Section 230 provides TikTok some legal protection, it does not bar claims that its product was defective and that its algorithm pushed videos about the blackout challenge to the child.""This was TikTok consistently sending dangerous challenges to an impressionable 10-year-old, sending multiple versions of this blackout challenge, which led her to believe this was cool and this would be fun,"" Goodman said.But TikTok's lawyer, Andrew Pincus, argued the panel should uphold a lower court judge's October 2022 ruling that Section 230 barred Anderson's case.Pincus warned that to rule against his client would render Section 230's protections ""meaningless"" and open the door to lawsuits against search engines and other platforms that use algorithms to curate content for their users.Story continues""Every claimant could then say, this was a product defect, the way the algorithm was designed,"" he said.U.S. Circuit Judge Patty Schwartz, though, questioned whether that law could fully protect TikTok from ""having to make a decision as to whether it was going to let someone who turned on the app know there's dangerous content here.""The arguments come as TikTok and other social media companies, including Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, are facing pressure from regulators around the globe to protect children from harmful content on their platforms.U.S. state attorneys general are investigating TikTok over whether the platform causes physical or mental health harm to young people.TikTok and other social media companies are also facing hundreds of lawsuits accusing them of enticing and addicting millions of children to their platforms, damaging their mental health.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Jonathan Oatis)"

Is bankruptcy a possibility?",2024-01-17,0.333333,"Spirit Airlines hasnt made money since before the pandemic, ticket sales havent bounced back as quickly as the carrier expected, and dozens of its planes will be grounded at times this year because of a
problem with the engines
.A sale to JetBlue represented a lifeline for Spirit, which faces $1.1 billion in debt maturing next year.But a federal judge in Boston scuttled that plan by ruling Tuesday that JetBlues $3.8 billion proposal to buy Spirit
violates antitrust law
.Now, some Wall Streeters who follow Spirit are tossing around the B word  bankruptcy. The judge had even hinted at such an outcome during the trial.After Judge William Young's ruling on Tuesday, Spirit can look for another buyer, or it could remain independent and try to push through a difficult environment for budget airlines.But a more likely scenario is a Chapter 11 filing, followed by a liquidation, wrote Helane Becker, a veteran airline analyst for financial-services firm Cowen. We recognize this sounds alarmist and harsh, but the reality is we believe there are limited scenarios that enable Spirit to restructure.JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker wasnt willing to go quite that far, but he too drew a grim picture for Spirit, which has the ticker symbol SAVE.We are not (yet) predicting an immediate SAVE chapter 11 filing, just an acknowledgement that we cannot reasonably identify a viable return to profitability any time soon, Baker and colleagues wrote in a note to clients.Baker noted that Spirit recently raised $419 million by mortgaging many of its planes. But, he added, ""from here its liquidity-raising cupboard does not appear robust.Fitch Ratings said Spirit's credit profile is now ""under pressure after the court defeat. We believe that Spirit needs to clearly articulate a near-term plan to preserve and generate liquidity, address its refinancing risk, and improve profitability to avoid a rating downgrade, the credit-rating agency said.Story continuesSpirit did not respond directly to those comments. A spokesperson for the airline pointed to a regulatory filing two weeks ago, in which the airline disclosed that it had raised $419 million through sale-and-leaseback agreements covering 25 planes.In a joint statement Tuesday, Spirit and JetBlue said they disagreed with the ruling that blocks their merger and were considering their next legal step.Judge Young stopped short of granting the government's wish for a permanent injunction against any merger between JetBlue and Spirit. During the trial, Young was troubled that such a sweeping order would be too restrictive in the ever-changing airline business.We are not going to get anywhere if you win, the merger isnt approved, and Spirit goes belly-up, the judge said to a Justice Department lawyer during closing arguments in December.Spirit, based in Miramar, Florida, last turned a full-year profit in 2019. It has lost more than $1.6 billion since then.On Wednesday, Bank of America analysts downgraded Spirit stock to underperform, suggesting there is a risk the airline might not be able to make debt payments due in September 2025.Spirit is also hindered by necessary inspections and possible replacement of Pratt & Whitney engines on many of its Airbus jets because of a manufacturing defect. The airline has predicted that it will
average 26 grounded planes
 more than 10% of its fleet  during 2024, causing a dramatic decrease in the companys near-term growth projections.Frontier Airlines tried to buy Spirit before JetBlue started  and won  a bidding war last year. But Frontier has its own challenges and is in no position to renew merger discussions with Spirit now, Baker said.Spirit shares fell 22% Wednesday after plunging 47% on Tuesday. JetBlue shares lost a more modest 9% on Wednesday, which might reflect investors breathing a sigh of relief that the purchase of Spirit appears dead, at least for now.Baker said JetBlue dodges a bullet because of the federal judges ruling. Under CEO Robin Hayes  who is stepping down next month  JetBlue wanted the planes and pilots that it would have gained through buying Spirit, but the price was simply just too much to pay, in Bakers view.Like Spirit, JetBlue has not had a profitable year since 2019, before the pandemic. But relative to its size, JetBlue's losses are more manageable than Spirits, and it has a stronger balance sheet, according to analysts.Investors are also trying to gauge what the ruling against the JetBlue-Spirit deal means for Alaska Airlines' pending proposal to buy Hawaiian Airlines. The
Biden administration
hasn't said whether it will sue to block that deal too.Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg said the government's success in blocking both the JetBlue-Spirit deal and a previous
partnership between JetBlue and American Airlines
are likely to cast a shadow over future airline (merger and acquisition) activity, with the AlaskaHawaiian deal potentially in the sights of regulators."

Investing.com,Fed's March Rate Cut Unlikely,2024-01-18,0.666667,"Investors continue to come back to their senses and the latter involves trimming the interest rate cut expectations that went ahead of themselves over the past few months. Yesterday, the Federal Reserves (Fed) Beige Book survey suggested that resilient consumer spending during the holiday season helped propel the US economy, and another solid rise in the US retail sales confirmed that spending in the US didnt slow by the end of last year. On the contrary, the latest data printed its highest pace in three months. As such, robust economic data added to the thinking that, yes, maybe March is too early for the Fed to announce the first rate cut; there is no apparent reason for the Fed to rush to the rate cuts as early as in March. The Fed will likely start cutting in the H1 but March seems overly optimistic given the ongoing strength of the economic data. The probability of a March cut fell to around 60% from around 80% at the start of the year, the

Yahoo Finance,Electric cars suffer unsustainable depreciation in secondhand market,2024-01-18,0.333333,"used electric carsElectric cars
lose as much as half of their value after just three years on the road, new figures show, as the rate of depreciation far outstrips conventional equivalents.Research from Auto Trader said there were unsustainable levels of depreciation in the electric car market, with used prices of battery-powered vehicles dropping by 23pc in the last year alone.The online vehicle marketplace said a motorist buying a 50,000 electric car could expect to lose 24,000 in value over three years, while a similarly priced petrol car could lose 17,000.The value of used electric cars has
dropped dramatically in the last 12 months
after Covid-related supply shortages eased and as rising electricity prices hit demand.This coincided with petrol prices falling to a two-year low.Auto Traders latest report warned that residual values of electric cars remain unsustainably low.It said that the price of used electric cars could come under further pressure this year as thousands of motorists return vehicles acquired on three-year leases and as manufacturers cut the price of new vehicles.With over 800,000 new electric cars registered between 2020 and 2023, supply returning to the used car market will only increase in 2024, and if demand does not keep up, electric cars could depreciate even further, undermining both consumer and retailer confidence, it said.Manufacturers are now
applying record discounts
to new electric vehicles in a bid to boost stuttering demand.Auto Trader said car makers were slashing thousands of pounds off prices, with average discounts of 10.6pc offered in December. This compares to discounts of 4.8pc a year earlier.It predicted that a
wave of Chinese entrants
would further push down the cost of electric cars.Sales of new battery-powered vehicles in Britain rose by 18pc last year but accounted for just 16.5pc of all new cars sold - a slight decline from 2022.New electric cars are still more than a third more expensive than their petrol or diesel equivalents.Story continuesHowever, from this month, electric cars will need to account for 22pc of every manufacturers sales, which analysts expect to lead to heavy price cuts to encourage consumers.Campaigners have said motorists will continue to
find electric cars too expensive
without government subsidies, which ended in 2022, or other incentives such as cuts to VAT.Auto Trader said demand for used electric cars had picked up as prices fell, suggesting that the vehicles will prove popular once they are no longer more expensive than petrol rivals.It said that used electric cars on its site tended to sell up to five days faster than petrol ones.This month, the Chinese manufacturer BYD
surpassed Tesla as the worlds best-selling electric car maker
. The companys cheapest electric vehicle retails for 25,000 in the UK, roughly double what it costs in China, which Auto Trader said gave it room to further cut prices in Britain.It predicted that one in six electric cars sold in Britain will be made by Chinese companies by 2030.Ian Plummer, Auto Traders commercial director, said motorists had been confused by Rishi Sunaks decision to push back a ban on petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 to 2035.He said that discounts applied to new electric cars meant most motorists would not bear the full cost of the depreciation in their value.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Lee told CNBC on Tuesday that the valuation of small caps relative to the S&P 500 haven't looked this appealing since 1999.
""That was a launch point for 12 years of gains,"" Lee said.An overlooked area of the stock market is set to soar in 2024 after significantly underperforming the
S&P 500
last year, according to Fundstrat's Tom Lee.In an interview on Tuesday, Lee
told CNBC
that small cap stocks could soar as much as 60% this year thanks to compelling valuations relative to the S&P 500.""I think small caps could make a bigger move [than large cap stocks], you know 50% or 60%. I think the Russell 2000 could end the year above 3,000,"" Lee said. The Russell 2000 traded at around 1,910 on Wednesday.The
Russell 2000
trailed the S&P 500 significantly in 2023, gaining about 17% compared to a gain of about 24% for the large cap index. That underperformance has spilled over into 2024. Year-to-date, the Russell 2000 is down about 7% compared to a 1% drop for the S&P 500.But Lee said that valuation measures make the small cap Russell 2000 index much more compelling when compared to the S&P 500.""Small caps relative to the S&P 500 on a price-to-book basis is back to where it was in 1999, which was the absolute low and was a launch point of 12 years of outperformance for small caps,"" Lee said.Lee has called small cap stocks his best idea for 2024, in part because of the idea that participation in the ongoing stock market rally is improving and is no longer concentrated in just mega-cap tech stocks, like it was in 2023. If so-called breadth improves in the stock market, then small cap stocks should catch a bid, Lee said in his 2024 outlook.Lee also said
in his 2024 outlook
that three factors could help boost small-cap stocks in 2024.First, fund flows into the stock market are necessary for small cap stocks to outperform, according to Lee. If retail funds aren't flowing into the stock market, then funds likely aren't flowing into small cap stocks. That could change in 2024 as investors start to warm up to the stock market.Story continuesSecond, small cap stocks are highly levered and tend to have a higher cost of capital, so a decline in interest rates should benefit small cap stocks much more than large cap stocks.Finally, an expansion in economic growth could be a ""huge tailwind"" for small cap stocks as they are highly exposed to the domestic economy.Read the original article on

 and CEO Elon Musk is putting public pressure on the company's board of directors to acquire it.Musk warned earlier this week that for him to steer the all-electric carmaker to become a global leader in artificial intelligence and robotics, he'd need even greater sway over the company's decisions.""He does have bargaining power in the sense that there is only one Elon Musk,"" said David Kass, a professor of finance at the University of Maryland. ""It looks like a negotiation.""In a post on X
, the social platform he owns, Musk said, ""I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having 25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I cant be overturned."" Otherwise, he said, ""I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.""Musk once held more than 20% of Tesla shares but sold a significant chunk to help finance his purchase of what was then Twitter. He currently holds a nearly 13% stake as the carmaker's largest shareholder.A threat? A negotiation? Both? No matter. Musk's latest salvo has, at the least, placed a harsh spotlight on ongoing governance issues at Tesla and the singular influence he holds over the company.Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.His latest demands, along with
a recent Wall Street Journal report
revealing some insiders' concerns about his alleged illicit drug use, raise further questions about whether the board is too cozy with the company's headstrong executive.
Musk criticized the Journal's report
and said he had not failed recent random drug tests, without explicitly denying the details of the article.""Whatever I'm doing, I should obviously keep doing it,"" he posted on X last week, boasting of his business successes.Power play?

(ASSOCIATED PRESS)50 billion reasons to careMusk's public complaints about control and compensation are notable due to the magnitude of his current CEO performance package, which has elevated him to the rarified status of the world's richest person. Set in 2018, Musk's pay package has the potential to add up to more than $50 billion.Story continuesThe conditional gains were so large that
a shareholder lawsuit filed the same year
alleged the plan constituted corporate waste and unjust enrichment, and that board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the plan. The trial was held in November 2022, and post-trial briefings and arguments are complete, according to Tesla's SEC filings.Musk said on X that ""the Tesla board is great. The reason for no new 'compensation plan' is that we are still waiting for a decision in my Delaware compensation case.""His push for greater control is significant because Tesla's board has
long drawn criticism
for not serving as a check on the notoriously impulsive executive.""I havent seen a situation like this before, but my first reaction is that a CEO wanting more control over a company would not be a reasonable justification for a large grant of shares for many investors,"" said Brianna Castro, senior director of US research at Glass Lewis, a shareholder advisory firm.Musk's litany of outbursts, rash decision making, and inflammatory public remarks have
prompted even loyal investors to criticize the board
for not holding Musk accountable.""Its time for Teslas board to wake up and do their job,""
one prominent Tesla bull said in late 2022
, at the height of the Twitter takeover drama. Other market observers over the years have called on the board to install a more even-keeled operator to help Musk run the company.'The board is his board'Critics have also
focused on the board's makeup itself
. Some members, they say, are too closely tied to Musk to exercise robust oversight as company directors.""Hes got a lot of power, plus the board is his board,"" said William Klepper, academic director and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. ""I dont see them having the strength of good governance to stand up to Elons request,"" he said.A close look at the
board members
and their connections to Musk supports Klepper's point.Several board members have personal ties to the executive. That has the potential to cloud their judgment when deciding on matters that could pit the interests of shareholders against those of Musk, the individual.That the board is comprised of several Musk allies also challenges the notion that the institution serves as an independent overseer of the executive, rather than as an advisory committee, or worse, as enablers with a sibling, friends, and business allies among the group.Here's a look at who sits on the company's board"

Steve HankeSteve Hanke expects stocks to falter, a recession to hit, and inflation to fall below 2% this year.
Stocks are trading at lofty valuations that will decrease as a downturn sets in, the economist says.
The shrinking US money supply will choke economic growth and curb the pace of price rises, he says.Expect the stock market to retreat, a recession to strike, and inflation to drop below 2% by the end of this year, Steve Hanke says.""As far as the outlook for stocks goes, they remain pricey, and the multiples will come off as the recession starts to bite,"" the professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University told Business Insider this week.The benchmark S&P 500 index rallied by 24% in 2023 and now trades close to a record high. Stocks are typically valued at multiples to company earnings, so they tend to fall when multiples contract or earnings shrink  both of which can happen in an economic downturn when investor sentiment and corporate profits usually suffer.Hanke, a former economic advisor to Ronald Reagan, served as the president of Toronto Trust Argentina when it was the world's best-performing market mutual fund in 1995. His view is that the volatile inflation of recent years is chiefly due to changes in the US money supply, not other factors such as supply-chain disruptions and swings in energy and metal prices.The veteran economist and a colleague, John Greenwood, predicted in July 2021 that the headline Consumer Price Index would rise as quickly as 9% on an annualized basis; it peaked at 9.1% a year later. They later forecast the inflation measure would fall to between 2% and 5% by December last year, and it ended the year at 3.4%.""As Milton Friedman taught us long ago, inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,"" Hanke said. ""That's why our forecast, based off the quantity theory of money, has been so accurate.""Now, Hanke and Greenwood predict headline inflation will fall below the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2% by the end of this year. They proposed in the
National Review
this week that 6% annual growth in M2, a broad measure of money supply, would likely keep inflation around the 2% mark.Story continuesThe two men
declared
in December that ""money is the economy's fuel,"" and material changes in its supply have a lagged effect on economic growth, spending, and the pace of price increases. They warned the US economy was ""running on fumes"" and ""on schedule to tank"" given its money supply had plunged since March 2022, after growing by a historic 27% in the year through February 2021 in part due to stimulus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.Hanke has been
issuing similar warnings
for some time. He
cautioned
last February that stocks could be hit by shrinking corporate profits and output, and

in August that complacent investors were ""sleepwalking"" into a market slump and a recession.Read the original article on

a WSJ report
that the Miramar, Fla., company is exploring options to refinance its debt following the merger's collapse.""We think they're going to shop themselves around,"" TD Cowen senior research analyst Helane Becker told Yahoo Finance on Thursday.The analyst thinks the ruling will dissuade other airlines from stepping up, forcing Spirit to restructure.""We think a Chapter 11 filing is more likely than unlikely,"" said Becker.Becker said if the airline is unable to lower its aircraft lease costs and the company is forced to liquidate, JetBlue could acquire some of the assets.""For JetBlue, we think this is actually not a bad outcome because we think they'll be able to get those assets in a liquidation of Spirit,"" she said immediately following the ruling.Frontier had made a bid for Spirit almost two years ago but was later outbid when JetBlue came in with an all cash $3.8 billion offer.If Frontier were to emerge as a buyer again, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Stathoulopoulos says the airline would have a better shot at obtaining regulatory approval than JetBlue did.Spirit stock has dropped roughly 60% since Tuesday when a federal judge blocked its merger with JetBlue.

Roth IRA
. While you wont pay any taxes if the assets youre rolling over are held in another Roth account, theres typically no way to completely avoid paying taxes when rolling pre-tax money into a Roth IRA. However, with a few strategic moves, you can potentially limit todays tax pain while still reaping the rewards of tomorrows tax-free benefits. To determine if a Roth rollover aligns with your overall savings and tax strategy, consider running the numbers with a
financial advisor
whos attuned to your financial situation and retirement vision.Roth Rollover RulesA Roth IRA is a retirement account that allows people to contribute after-tax dollars. Unlike a
traditional IRA
, you dont get a tax break on Roth contributions. However, qualified Roth withdrawals in retirement can be made tax-free. This differs from traditional IRAs, whose contributions are often tax-deductible but withdrawals are taxed as
ordinary income
.In general, you can roll over funds from another retirement account such as a
traditional IRA or 401(k)
into a Roth IRA. This is called a
Roth conversion or Roth rollover
. When you convert funds, you owe income taxes on the amount thats rolled over for that year. So if you roll over $50,000 from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, the $50,000 is added to your taxable income for the year.Its important to understand that Roth rollovers are not the same as Roth contributions. Higher-income taxpayers may not qualify to make direct Roth contributions. However, there are no income limits on doing
Roth conversions
from other accounts.You can roll over funds from 401(k)s,
403(b)s
,
457 plans
, traditional IRAs,
SEP IRAs and Simple IRA
s. To start the process, contact the institution that holds the account you want to roll over and convert. They can help facilitate the transfer. You typically have 60 days to complete the conversion, otherwise, the IRS will treat the transfer as a distribution and you could be hit with a 10%
early withdrawal penalty
. But if you need additional help determining how much to roll over and convert, consider speaking with a
financial advisor

, the report says.Russian oil exports rose by 500,000 barrels a day (kb/d) in December but estimated export revenues slumped to a six-month low of $14.4bn (11.3bn), as Russian oil price discounts increased and benchmark oil prices declined, the IEA concludes.Putins revenues have gone down massively, says Ashley Kelty, director of oil and gas research at Panmure Gordon.Global prices have gone down overall and he is having to sell oil at a big discount to that reduced price.Hes been selling bigger volumes of oil mainly to refineries in China and India but at discounts of as much as $35 a barrel, so the increased volume does not compensate for the reduced price.The same IEA report also suggests that the
decades-long control of global oil markets
exercised by Opec and its allies, which include Russia, may finally be coming to an end.A surge in oil exports from Guyana, Canada, Brazil and, above all, the US, means Opecs overall market share is steadily reducing. There may be no way back, say analysts.The Opec+ cartel is fracturing, says Kelty. They have been caught out by the rise in production from the US and other countries which means they are losing their historic control over prices.If sustained, it could herald a seismic shift in a global oil market that has long been dominated by producers in the Middle East and Russia.It could also, say analysts, spell big trouble not just for Putin, who relies on energy revenues to fund 45pc of Russias federal and defence budgets, but also for countries like Saudi Arabia.Story continuesThe Gulf state also relies on oil revenues to keep its population happy.Opec, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, was founded in 1960 by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela to strip control of global oil production from the UK and the British companies that then dominated.It now has 12 members and formed a wider network called Opec+ in 2016 that involved another 10 oil-producing states, including Russia.The groups key weapon
is their control over the supply of oil
. Almost 80pc of the worlds proven supplies are in Opec countries.Turning off the taps and restricting supply has always driven prices up and forced Western leaders to come begging. The ability to control price has showered huge wealth on Opec members, particularly in the Middle East.The power that goes with controlling fuel supplies helped to embolden Putin in Ukraine. He assumed Europe would have to give way once Russia invaded because he controlled their gas and a large amount of their oil.What has happened instead is that the free market has begun to take over.Flows of oil into Europe from Russia have reduced but they have been quickly replaced by oil from the US, Norway and newer sources like Guyana and Brazil.The loss of Russian product imports to European and US markets saw the re-routing of global trade flows, under the pressure of the EU embargo and G7 sanctions, the IEA says in its report.As a result, Opec+s share of the market is shrinking. The control it has exercised for decades is slipping away in the process. That change is happening even though global demand for oil is expected to reach a record high this year at more than 102m barrels a day. Record-breaking output from the United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada will more than meet demand, the IEA says.These four non-Opec+ producers, all from the Americas, are expected to add a combined 1.3 mb/d [million barrels per day], with the United States contributing more than half the gains to once again lead the worlds supply expansion.Last month, weekly US oil production hit 13.2m barrels per day, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Thats above the Donald Trump-era record of 13.1m set in early 2020 just before the pandemic sent prices and production crashing.The recent surge in US output has been the key factor in keeping a lid on the prices of petrol, diesel, jet fuel and all the other products derived from oil and gas. Those products range from road surfacings (bitumen) to carpets and clothes (polyester) and all kinds of plastic.In fact, US output  led by shale drillers in Texas and New Mexicos Permian Basin  is so strong that America is exporting the same amount of crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids as Saudi Arabia or Russia produces.With their power diminishing, Opec+
has been riven with infighting
. A November meeting was delayed at the last minute amid reports that African members, who heavily rely on oil revenues day-to-day, were reluctant to agree to Saudi plans to cut their output.Shortly after, Angola, which had been an Opec member since 2007, quit.We realised Angola does not gain anything by keeping in the organisation, the countrys resources minister Diamantino de Azevedo said at the time.Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec, says the expansion to Opec+ was an attempt to regain control of global markets as it was slipping by broadening the groups influence. However, members competing interests have made it harder to agree on tactics.At recentmeetings, forexample, the Saudis wanted a cut in production but other members were unwilling to lose oil revenues.Mr MacPherson says"

have between $100,000 and $1 million liquid assets with an annual household income above $75,000.

They are also the second-largest economic subsection of consumers in the country, living an upper-middle-class lifestyle and holding substantial liquid assets (as opposed to illiquid assets, such as real estate).The defining factor of mass affluent individuals is the combination of income and assets.

Shares of the AI juggernaut are up some 18% in the first few weeks of the new year and 179% over the last 12 months. And its market cap is quickly approaching $1.5 trillion.But Nvidia isnt the only company benefiting from the AI hype. Rival AMD (

(via REUTERS / Reuters)Zuckerberg also said he wants to make Metas general AI open source, allowing others to use and work with it.Nvidia is the world leader in AI chip development, with an estimated market share of between 70% and 90% of the global market. But its not just Nvidias hardware that helps it stay ahead of its rivals. The companys
Cuda software
, which developers use to create AI platforms, also serves as a moat that keeps Nvidia above the fray.That said, Nvidias rivals are gathering with the intent of snatching market share. In December, AMD debuted its MI300 accelerator, which is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidias data center accelerators. Intel, meanwhile, is building out its own Gaudi3 AI accelerator, which will also compete with Nvidias offerings.Its not just AMD and Intel, though. Hyperscalers, which include cloud service providers Microsoft (

(Yahoo Finance)Think of AI graphics accelerators from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel as jacks of all trades. They can be used for a litany of different AI-related tasks, ensuring that whatever a company needs, the chips can handle it.ASICs, on the other hand, are masters of a single trade. Theyre built specifically for a companys own AI needs and often are more efficient than the graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.Thats a problem for Nvidia, as hyperscalers are huge spenders when it comes to AI GPUs. But as ASICs start to take hold, they may have less of a need for Nvidias chips.Still, the AI explosion is only beginning. And the vast majority of companies that will benefit from AI have yet to get into the game. In other words, theres still plenty of room to grow. Even if Nvidias market share takes a hit, its revenue will continue to increase as the AI space booms.For now, though, Nvidia remains the AI king.Daniel Howley

Yahoo Finance,Bitcoin ETFs have been out for a weekheres how theyre doing,2024-01-19,0.666667,"Happy Friday. The crypto industry spent months pinning its hopes on the long-awaited arrival of Bitcoin ETFs, which would help it break out of a painful bear market and let digital assets take their rightful place in the world of mainstream finance. Those ETFs finally arrived last Thursday. So were they a success? An initial flurry of marketing spin made it hard to tell, but now some clear signals are emerging.On the price front, Bitcoin has actually slumped significantly since the launch, but that doesn't mean the ETFs have been a flop. The slump follows a wild run-up in crypto prices that came in anticipation the SEC would approve the new product, so the recent drop reflects an expected ""sell the news"" moment. Meanwhile, the market for Bitcoin ETFs is already reportedly more valuable than the one for silver with BlackRock's ETF already pulling in
more than $1 billion
on its own.More intriguing is what comes next. I spoke with Ophelia Snyder, whose 21.co helped stand up Ark Invest's Bitcoin ETF, which was fourth of the 11 new ETFs with $2.7 million of trading volume on Thursday, to get a better sense of where things are going. She made the case that much of the early movement is from organic retail trading and that the market can expect a lot more inflows once financial advisors start recommending Bitcoin ETFs to their clients.According to Snyder, these advisors are currently able to pick up the phone and fill a customer's order for Bitcoin shares but need to assess the market before actively putting them in portfolios. She expects that to happen in the coming weeks and months, which will drive up demandand of course the price. Snyder is obviously not impartial here but her thesis makes sense.Another thing that's becoming apparent one week into Bitcoin ETF trading is which of the 11 newly launched ETFs are gaining significant market share. While assets under management tell part of the story, that metric can also be misleading since some of the funds' size reflects, in Snyder's words, a ""bring your own assets"" playbookmeaning they drew on their own capital to help juice their launches. That's the case with category leaders BlackRock and Fidelity and with BitWise, which launched with a ""seed partner"" that invested heavily.Story continuesThe better way to assess the new ETFs' early performance is by daily trading volume and, on that front, BlackRock and Fidelity are also way out front with volumes of $17.7 million and $9.7 million on Thursday. BitWise was next with $2.8 million, just ahead of Ark. Meanwhile, the other new ETFs (aside from Grayscale, which is a special case) posted less than 10% of those volumes, raising questions about their long-term viability.The upshot of all this is that the long-awaited Bitcoin ETFs are an initial success, and, if optimists like Snyder are right, this is just the beginning.Jeff John Roberts

rebounding sharply after a difficult 2022. However, the performance hasn't been great across the board. Small-cap stocks have underperformed their larger counterparts, some sectors haven't rebounded nearly as much as the overall stock market, and a lot of the 2023 gains in the S&P 500 were fueled by a handful of massive companies.Because of these facts, there could be some excellent opportunities for patient investors to put money to work.

The Russell 2000 benchmark index gained 7 percentage points less than the S&P 500 in 2023 and has already underperformed through the first couple of weeks of 2024.However, small caps could be some of the biggest beneficiaries of falling interest rates, which is widely expected to happen this year.

That has more to do with your exposure and risk of loss than with how much you have to lose.As to whether someone would need umbrella insurance in this scenario, the answer is truly a maybe. It depends on your current insurance coverage, the costs of extra coverage and the specific risks you're concerned about.Do you have questions about financial planning?

You are considered at-fault in an auto accident with a driver who suffers $95,000 worth of damage to their car and $155,000 worth of personal injuries and lost wages.Your insurance policy could pay for the first $150,000 of this claim. Then, an umbrella insurance policy could pay that remaining $100,000 for which you would otherwise be personally liable.Why Get Umbrella Insurance?The main reason to buy umbrella insurance is third-party liability.By and large, you can know in advance the value of your own property and assets, whether personal or
real estate
. Since this is knowable, you can buy insurance to cover most cases of personal loss.Liability is another matter. It's impossible to predict with any certainty the value of a third party's assets or injuries. You might be in a car accident someday, or accidentally injure a guest at a party. Since accidents are impossible to predict, so are the costs and harms associated with them. This is where umbrella insurance comes in, as it covers you in case of unpredictable liability that exceeds your policy's coverage.Story continuesMost consumers who get umbrella insurance will use it to supplement either auto or homeowner's policies. Typically you must have an existing primary insurance policy, as this will not act as your main insurance. For homeowners, this can supplement coverage that you get based on your personal needs and mortgage requirements. For drivers, this can supplement coverage that you have based on your personal needs and your state minimum coverage laws.Umbrella Insurance Costs and CoverageLike all insurance, the specific costs of umbrella insurance vary based on your policy and coverage needs. However, in most cases, individual umbrella policies offer liability-focused coverage. This means that your policy will typically cover third-party injury, harms and property losses. For
homeowners
, this coverage will typically extend to general liability protection, for example if someone sues for defamation.This is why the need for umbrella insurance is typically unrelated to your personal wealth. The reason for umbrella insurance is risk of accident and loss, not necessarily collectible assets. Someone with $25,000 in cash is as much at risk of losing everything as someone with $1 million. Indeed, arguably the more money you have the less you might need umbrella coverage, since you can more likely afford excess claims, though umbrella coverage can be pricey.These policies typically do not protect your own assets and personal property, as you are assumed to price out your own assets within your primary insurance policy. They also typically dont cover intentional or criminal acts, and frequently do not cover cases of contributory recklessness.Since these are high-coverage policies, you typically will buy umbrella insurance in increments of $1 million. While professionals like doctors and lawyers will typically have liability protection through their workplace, someone with a higher public profile or who frequently invites people onto their property is at more risk of lawsuits, and so might want to consider more protection.Bottom LineUmbrella insurance is a policy that offers you additional coverage beyond your basic homeowner's or auto insurance. Most policies are built around liability, protecting you from third party claims that exceed your policy's caps.Homeowner's Insurance TipsA

Yahoo Finance,History Suggests the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024,2024-01-20,0.555556,"The macroeconomic challenges of the past couple of years are beginning to fade, and investors are looking to the future. After the
Nasdaq Composite
plunged in 2022, suffering its worst performance since 2008, the index enjoyed a robust recovery in 2023 and gained 43%.There could be more to come. Since the Nasdaq Composite began trading in 1972, in every year following a market recovery, the tech-heavy index rose again -- and those second-year gains averaged 19%. The economy is the wildcard here, though, and it could yet stumble in 2024. But historical patterns suggest that this could be a good year for investors.Recent developments in the field of
artificial intelligence (AI)
helped fuel the market's rise last year and will likely drive further gains in 2024.

Yahoo Finance,"With Germany in recession and Detroit reeling over ultra-cheap Chinese EVs, Beijing vows to crack down on blind construction of new projects",2024-01-19,0.333333,"China is making automakers around the world nervous. Its domestic carmakershelped by generous state subsidiesare churning out alarmingly inexpensive electric vehicles at a relentless pace, saturating their home market and threatening EV manufacturers overseas.But they might be getting carried away, a high-ranking Chinese official suggested on Friday.Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, said that Beijing would take forceful measures to address what he called blind construction of new EV projectsi.e., not justified by demandby some Chinese carmakers and local authorities, as
reported
by the
Financial Times
.His comments come amid pressure from Europe in particular over a flood of low-priced Chinese EVs hitting its markets.Their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in September. And as we do not accept this distortion from the inside in our market, we do not accept this from the outside.To be sure, its more the threat posed by Chinese EVs in the long run than the current reality that has EU officials concerned. In Germany, the center of EU automaking, Chinese EVs still have just a
small sliver
of market share. But its growing fast, and that has many in Europes automotive powerhouse worried amid
fresh economic woes
, even as German carmakerswho do brisk business in Chinahave
warned against tariffs
on Chinese EVs for fear of retaliation by Beijing.EU probes Chinese subsidiesIn the weeks ahead, EU investigators
will visit Chinese EV makers
BYD
, Geely, and SAIC as part of a probe into whether they have an unfair advantage thanks to government subsidies. Their visitspart of an EU probe
announced
in September and set to run for 13 monthswill help determine whether the EU imposes higher tariffs to protect European carmakers.Of course, more than subsidies are at play. The Chinese car companies are extremely competitive,
Tesla
CEO Elon Musk
said
at the
New York Times
Dealbook conference last year. China is super good at manufacturing, and the work ethic is incredible.Story continuesMusk suggested that Chinese companies will emerge as dominant players in the global automotive industrya sharp departure from when he
laughed about
the quality of BYD cars in 2011.Chinese EV makers also have supply-chain efficiencies that are tough to beat. BYD, for instance, keeps its costs low partly by owning the entire supply chain of its EV batteries, significant since a battery accounts for roughly 40% of an electric vehicles price. Backed by Warren Buffetts
Berkshire Hathaway
, the Chinese carmaker
recently overtook Tesla
in global sales of electric vehicles.Whereas Chinese EV makers face 27.5% tariffs in the U.S., in the EU that's just 10%. Thats encouraged them to target Europe as their home market gets increasingly crowded, although theyre also expanding quickly elsewhere, including
in Southeast Asia
and
Latin America
.Last year, an
Allianz
Trade report stated that Chinas EV makers
pose a significant threat
to European carmakers, particularly the automotive-dependent economies of Germany, Slovakia and Czech Republic. It called for higher tariffs on Chinese EVs, estimating that by 2030 they could cost Europes carmakers 7 billion euros per year in lost profits.In the EU, Chinese-made EVs typically sell for 20% less than those made in the bloc, and their share of the EV market, which has grown to 8%, could reach 15% by 2025, according to Reuters.The coming wave of Chinese EVs in AmericaLast year in China, BYD launched the Seagull, an EV with a cutthroat price of about $11,000. It quickly became one of the best-selling EVs in China. The Seagull and similar models from China could prove to be a
disruptive force
in overseas markets.Chinese EVs might also become a common sight on American roads, eventually.No one can match BYD on price. Period, Michael Dunne, CEO of Asia-focused car consultancy Dunne Insights,
told
the
Financial Times
earlier this month. Boardrooms in America, Europe, Korea, and Japan are in a state of shock.Made-in-China EVs are sold in more than 100 countries, and the U.S. is the only market where they have not yet really begun a big assault, ZoZo Go CEO Michael Dunne, whose advisory firm specializes in the Chinese EV industry,
told
the
Wall Street Journal
.Chinese EV makers are now searching for manufacturing sites in Mexico, which has a free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada and could
serve as a backdoor
to those markets, a scenario American lawmakers have
warned about
.Meanwhile, U.S. automakers have largely scaled back their EV ambitionsafter making large initial investmentsas demand has not been as great as anticipated. In a sign of the times, perhaps, all four of Americas largest carmakers
passed on running Super Bowl ads
this yearthe first time thats happened in 23 years.But the threat from China has industry leaders on edge. Last summer, Ford executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. warned that American automakers are not quite yet ready to compete with Chinese rivals on EVs. They developed very quickly, and theyve developed them in large scale, and now they are exporting, he
told
CNN. They are not here, but they will come here we think at some point and we need to be ready.This story was originally featured on

Investing.com,S&P 500's New Record High Could Signal Potential for Extended Gains Ahead,2024-01-22,0.555556,"As we all know, the
S&P 500
index achieved a new intraday record high last Friday. It is the most recent of the three major U.S. indexes to attain such a milestone since the bear market of 2022, joining the
Nasdaq 100
index and the
Dow Jones Industrial Average
.Having peaked nearly two years ago, the S&P 500 experienced a decline of as much as a quarter of its value, reaching a closing low of 3,577 on Oct. 12, 2022. This means the index went 512 trading days without a record until Friday, placing it as the sixth-longest streak since 1928, according to Ned Davis Research.Despite the seemingly negative milestone, it is worth noting that historical data indicates that one year after reaching new highs, the index has risen 13 out of 14 times, with an average increase of +13%.Moreover, except for the off year in 2022, the index has recorded a double-digit annual return for four of the last five years.Tech stocks posted a solid rally on Thursday and Friday, driven by an optimistic 2024 outlook from chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:
TSM
). This contributed to an outperformance of mega-cap tech stocks, resulting in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq erasing their 2024 losses and turning positive year-to-date.As per data from Societe Generale, hedge funds currently maintain the highest level of
Nasdaq 100 futures
buying in nearly seven years.Meanwhile, a global survey of fund managers conducted by Bank of America showed that the most crowded trades by investors are in the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, namely Alphabet (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
), Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
), Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
), Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
), Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
), Meta (NASDAQ:
META
) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
).Yes, the Magnificent Seven had an extraordinary year in 2023, but one that will be very difficult to repeat. They each returned +49% or more in 2023 and were responsible for the lion's share of the S&P 500's gains last year.This is the first time the seven largest stocks have posted such returns since at least 1999. But heading into 2024 on Wall Street they already have their new Magnificent 7 list for the fiscal year.It includes most of the 2023 Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Nvidia), while Apple, Meta and Tesla are left out and in their place come Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:
BRKa
), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:
UNH
) and Visa (NYSE:
V
).The typical stock market seasonal pattern or pattern in presidential election years (as is the current 2024 White House election) is weakness in the first half of the year and strength in the second half.The average return for the Dow Jones in the first half of the year is -4.3%. The second half of presidential election years is a different story, with the stock market stronger than in non-election years. The Dow Jones performance in the second half of election years has an average return of +8.6%.One explanation for this pattern is that the market performs poorly at first in reaction to the economic uncertainty created by the candidates' policies and as the year progresses the candidates are explaining their proposals and running campaigns that excite.Healthcare stocks are off to a strong start this year, actually leading the pack as the best-performing sector in the S&P 500 for 2024. This success is attributed to their attractive valuations relative to earnings and a compelling growth story.Eli Lilly (NYSE:
LLY
) continues to shine as the top-performing stock in the sector, having surged by +78.1% in 2023. This impressive performance has landed the drugmaker among the S&P 500's top 10 most valuable companies.Other players in the healthcare sector are also making strategic moves, with involvement from health insurers like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:
UNH
), pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie (NYSE:
ABBV
), Viatris (NASDAQ:
VTRS
), and medical device makers like Dexcom (NASDAQ:
DXCM
).A noteworthy development is the recent occurrence of the ""golden cross"" pattern in several of these stocks, where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average. Interestingly, the entire sector witnessed a golden cross during the first week of January.It's worth noting that the golden cross pattern is generally seen as a bullish indicator.The Health Care Select Sector ETF (NYSE:

rose by 0.32% last Friday but still recorded its biggest weekly decline in 6 weeks as strong US macroeconomic data and hawkish messages from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials lowered expectations of an early rate cut.Market expectations of US monetary policy remain the most important factor affecting
XAU/USD
's price as the market speculates when the Fed will deliver a rate cut. Traders now price in around a 44% chance of the rate cut in March, dropping from 71% last week, according to the CME Fed Watch Tool.Gold is declining as the possibility of the rate cut decreases because the high base rate puts downward pressure on the non-yielding metal. 'Until the first cut is delivered, the market may at times run ahead of itself, in the process building up rate cut expectations to levels that leave prices vulnerable to a correction,' said Ole Hansen, the Saxo Bank's head of commodity strategy.XAU/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the volatility in gold may be relatively low as the macroeconomic calendar is uneven. However, several releases later this week will noticeably affect XAU/USD.The pair has decently declined due to improved US consumer sentiment, solid labor market data, and strong retail sales figures, indicating the US economy's resilience. The Purchasing Managers' Index will come out on Tuesday, and inflation data will be released on Friday. If figures are higher than expected, it will support the view that there will be fewer rate cuts in 2024. Thus, XAU/USD may move lowerpossibly below the critical 2,000 mark.On Friday, the euro's (EUR) price rose by 0.21% as the
US dollar
slightly declined, pausing after rising for five consecutive trading sessions.The
US Dollar Index
(DXY), measuring the US dollar exchange rate against six other major currencies, dropped by 0.08% towards 103.26 on Friday. Still, the DXY gained 0.8% last week, while the euro depreciated. The US economy remains strong despite high-interest rates.Last week's releases showed a strong Michigan Consumer Sentiment report and labor market data, decreasing expectations of a rate cut in Q1 below 50%. Investors are now considering May to be the month when the Fed will announce the first rate cut. Fed officials, including Governors Waller, Goolsbee, and Daly, emphasized the need to assess inflation data carefully and suggested it's premature to expect rate reductions.Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan advanced its forecast for the European Central Bank (ECB), shifting anticipations of rate cuts from September to June. However, the firm maintained a cautious stance regarding inflation and wage growth trends. 'To avoid raising the number of cuts from 3 to 5, we assume that the ECB skips July and then starts back-to-back cuts in September,' commented an economist, Greg Fuzesi.EUR/USD
was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders should focus on ECB President Christine Lagarde's speech at 2:00 p.m. UTC. Any indication that the ECB is prepared to keep the monetary policy tight for longer will have a bullish impact on the EUR/USD. However, the euro may drop if statements are more dovish-like.The Japanese yen (JPY) continued to consolidate in the 148.200 area in a relatively quiet trading session on Friday.USD/JPY
has been trading sideways for the past 3 trading sessions as traders refrained from placing large orders in JPY pairs ahead of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) interest rate decision on 23 January.Although the market largely anticipates the regulator to leave its ultra-loose monetary policy unchanged, traders also wait for clear forward guidance on the future path of interest rates. Last time, the BOJ surprised the market by not providing any signals about future policy changes, resulting in a USD/JPY rally.This time, the Japanese central bank may have to provide at least some hawkish signals because the JPY has depreciated by over 5% since the beginning of the year. Fundamentally, monetary policy is a bearish factor for USD/JPY as BOJ's stance appears to be getting more hawkish than the Federal Reserve's (Fed).USD/JPY was declining slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the formal macroeconomic calendar is uneventful, so the pair may continue to move in a tight range until the BOJ interest rate decision on the morning of 23 January. However, the short-term technical bias remains bullish as the USD/JPY trades above an important level of 147.600."
Investing.com,This Week in Financial Markets,2024-01-22,0.333333,"In the past week, major financial markets have suffered a setback as central bankers tried to dampen investors' hopes about possible rate cuts.
However, the NASDAQ saw an uptick thanks to the semiconductor sector, which set a new all-time high while awaiting earnings reports from the exchange's major companies.
Volatility is always around the corner with each new set of data or corporate results.Each week in our column, we will analyze the most promising stocks and futures contracts in the financial markets at the moment.This good performance is also supported by better-than-expected quarterly results from Taiwanese giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:
TSM
). In our Technical Analysis video, we will examine whether this positive trend will continue in the coming days.
One of the worst stocks of the weekend was Plug Power (NASDAQ:
PLUG
) Inc. The U.S.-based hydrogen fuel cell company fell sharply after announcing a $1 billion stock sale, which will be used to support the group's working capital and capital expenditures.With recent problems in liquid hydrogen supply in North America, the company had already raised doubts about its ability to continue its operations last November. Is it possible for the company to go bankrupt?After a week of slowdown in the United States due to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations, macroeconomic activity showed some stability. With the exception of the Empire State manufacturing index, which fell to -43.7 instead of the expected -5. Meanwhile, world financial leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos and delivered stiff speeches to counter investors' expectations of a future rate cut.
However, the concept of ""higher rates for longer"" is relatively simple to understand. Even as equity markets remain unstable, yields have been secretly rising, as evidenced by the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which has exceeded 4.07 percent.
The
S&P 500
and other stock markets may see a slowdown in their upward momentum as the monetary easing that began in October comes to an end.WTI Crude
Oil Future prices rose slightly this week, but remain below $80 per barrel. Tensions in the Red Sea continue with the United States carrying out new attacks against the Houthis in Yemen.At the time of writing, the price of
Bitcoin
is around $41,000, disappointing traders' expectations. However, Ether is registering a 1 percent increase to $2,500. Despite the approval of as many as 11 Bitcoin Spot ETFs last week in the United States and transaction volumes exceeding $10 billion, bitcoin is marking time.
It is important to note that the demand for these ETFs had already pushed up the price of BTC in 2023, especially when BlackRock (NYSE:
BLK
) joined the game last June. In the end, the strategy - buy when an asset-related event is announced (buy the rumor) and sell when the event occurs (sell the news) - as outlined in previous articles, worked.In the metals sector, things do not look good as the downward trend continues. In London, a ton of
copper
fell to nearly $8,200, while aluminum lost ground at $2,130 and zinc continued its descent to $2,440.
It is true that China's recent economic performance is mixed: although GDP grew at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in 2023, economists were expecting a better outcome. Even Future Gold is losing ground, affected by rising bond yields. Currently, one ounce of gold is trading at about $2025.China is still struggling with a difficult economic situation, with GDP forecast for 2023 below expectations and troubling news from the real estate sector.
Despite this, Beijing is avoiding stimulus measures to support the economy. This is reflected in the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets, which remain under negative pressure."
Investing.com,Busy Week Ahead,2024-01-22,0.555556,"Fridays economic data was yet another proof of the diverging fortunes between the US economy and the rest of the developed world.In the morning, the UK announced that its retail sales slumped for the second straight year, fueling the worries of a mild recession in the UK this year. But in the afternoon, Michigans consumer sentiment index showed an advance to a more than two-year high, the expectations improved more than expected, with falling inflation expectations as a cherry on top.Remember, the US retail sales also showed a shiny number for the past holiday season.The prospects of Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts and the likely scenario of soft landing hint that there is a growing chance that we see the
US 10-year yield
go back to where it belongs  above the
2-year yield
.Right now, the US 2-year yield stands near 4.40%, the 10-year yield advanced past 4.10%, and the
US dollar
has been unable to clear the 200-DMA last week, but the strong US data versus weak data from the rest of the world would justify a swift move above this 200-DMA and the US stocks  especially the US technology stocks continue to fly high in the first month of this new year.The
S&P 500
finally hit an ATH level last Friday. Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) extended its gains to a fresh record as well, thanks to Metas announcement that it will be buying 350000 cutting-edge chips from Nvidia to power its AI systems. Some estimate that Metas purchases will ensure around $10bn revenue this year for Nvidia from Meta (NASDAQ:
META
) alone.Overall, strong US economic data has been tempering the expectation of a March rate cut from the Fed. But the Fed is still broadly expected to cut in May, if it doesnt in March. The US yields are drifting gently higher from last years end levels. The rebounding yields weigh heavier on the S&P493; the equal-weighted index continues to underperform the Magnificent 7.The earnings season continues full swing with Netflix (NASDAQ:
NFLX
) and Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) due to announce their latest quarterly results this week.The weeks economic calendar is also busy with major central bank meetings including the Bank of Japan (BoJ), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BoC).The BoJ will not normalize rates this week. In the best-case scenario, it will give further hints regarding the timing of the first rate hike  perhaps April.More realistically, the Japanese policymakers will push back on the normalization expectations and say that the monetary policy in Japan will remain supportive for as long as needed. The
USD/JPY
opened the week near the 148 level. The risks are tilted to the downside as the risk of a verbal intervention increases into the 150 level.The ECB and the BoC will certainly keep their rates unchanged, but the nuance in their accompanying statement will be closely watched for any hints regarding the first rate cut. ECB Chief Lagarde said last week in Davos that the ECB could lower rates by or in summer. The
EUR/USD
is flirting with the 1.09 level this morning. Any hint that the ECB is ready to cut rates will weaken the euro bulls hands for a sustainable rise above the 1.10 level."
Investing.com,Wall Street Bulls in Control of the Narrative,2024-01-22,0.555556,"The report on retail sales last week revealed a solid growth of 0.1% in December, indicating a robust economic performance. Additionally, retail sales from the control group experienced an increase of 0.8%, suggesting a likely growth in the GDP for the past quarter exceeding 1.5%, in line with the expectations of the Federal Reserve.These results support the continuity of economic growth in the United States. A noteworthy increase is evident, especially when compared to the year 2022, particularly in sectors such as online sales, which surged by almost 30%, and restaurant food, which grew by nearly 8%, becoming the primary expenditure in personal budgets.This factor is crucial, especially in the U.S. economy, which relies on 70% of domestic consumption. However, a contraction is observed in segments like furniture and department store sales.Regarding monetary policy, the report indicates that there is no immediate urgency to reduce interest rates. We will continue to closely monitor this matter. It's worth noting that a strong economy coupled with decreasing inflation would create a perfect environment for stock bulls even if the FED takes a little longer to lower rates, as a soft-landing scenario with the FED reducing rates, and the economy avoiding recession is usually an instance where stocks tend to perform better than average. Time will tell, but it seems like a great time to remain invested."
Investing.com,This Time Was Different? How the Economy Defied Every Recession Model,2024-01-23,0.222222,"The resilience of the US economy in 2023 was a surprise for some (several?) economists.From the start of last year through the first half, and in some case into early Q3, an ample supply recession warnings flowed like wine from the lips of the punditocracy.A careful reading of the data
suggested otherwise
, but high-risk warnings draw a crowd and so the dark forecasts endured and prospered, running well beyond their shelf life.With the clarity of hindsight, the macro mea culpas are now in full swing. Ditto for efforts at reassessing recession models that were thought to be reliable but have subsequently proven shaky, or at least in need of a tune-up.There are many flavors of the re-evaluation, ranging from analyzing why the so-called infallible inverted-yield-curve signal failed to the misleading recession signaling of the Leading Economic Index. To be fair, these and other widely followed recession indicators may yet prove accurate, but for the moment the US economic expansion rolls on.An intriguing explanation for why many recession models failed last year: resiliency in residential construction payrolls. One veteran observer of all things housing yesterday explained that this data is effectively the missing link for why conventional recession models stumbled.Indeed, sliding employment in the housing construction industry has been a useful recession predictor but has been conspicuously absent lately, as shown in the chart below. This is a bit surprising, given the weakness in housing starts.How influential is housing for the business cycle? A research paper famously argued that Housing IS the Business Cycle, which aligns with Mohtashamis analysis.Minds will differ, of course. That includes the debate about the probability that a recession is near. The recessionistas (the macro equivalent of permabears) never admit defeat; instead, they routinely move the start date of the next recession forward, a clever strategy that ensures theyll always be correct eventually.Meanwhile, the housing-construction-worker factor, if correct, looks set to support the soft-landing forecasts in the near term.Home builder sentiment rebounded sharply in January, suggesting that the housing activity may become a net plus for the economy this year after taking a beating in 2023. If so, the missing link for revising recession models may be (re)discovered anew by baffled business-cycle analysts in the months ahead."
Investing.com,Yen Rebounds as Ueda Hints at Policy Shift,2024-01-23,0.666667,"The yen was the protagonist on Tuesday, coming under some selling interest after the BoJ kept its ultra-loose policy unchanged as expected and lowered its forecasts for core inflation for the fiscal year beginning in April to 2.4% from 2.8% projected in October.
Nonetheless, at the press conference following the decision, Governor Ueda said that they expect the Japanese economy to pick up moving forward and that the likelihood of achieving their inflation 2% objective is gradually rising. He also added that theyve heard encouraging comments from big firms on wage hikes, and that a policy change is possible even when there is no update to the quarterly outlook, even though they will have more data to work with in April than March.
Uedas comments allowed the yen to stage a solid comeback, and take the drivers seat among the major currencies, as investors brought forth their expectations regarding a potential interest rate hike. They are now nearly fully factoring in a hike from -0.1% to 0% in June, while ahead of Uedas presser, a 10bps hike was factored in for July. They are even assigning a 23% chance to the March decision.
As for the much-discussed April meeting, the first after the shunto wage negotiations, the probability for a hike has gone from below 50% to slightly above 60%, which means that there is ample room for upside adjustment should upcoming data and speeches by BoJ officials corroborate that view. This could help the yen extend todays recovery.
Dollar slides, stocks gain on China headlines
The US dollar was sold across the board today, perhaps on increasing risk appetite after news hit the wires that China is considering a 1trln yuan worth of fiscal stimulus and a similar sized bond stimulus in order to heal its wounded stock market.
Chinese stocks rose after the report, while the
aussie
and the
kiwi
rebounded, which suggests that investors are cheering the stimulus plan. However, global money managers, who have been selling Chinese stocks after the post-pandemic recovery faded, said that it will take a long time and more stimulus to repair the property sector, which accounts for nearly a quarter of Chinas GDP. This means that todays news may not be enough to turn the tide for Chinese equities.
Wall Street extends rally, gold rebounds
All three of Wall Streets main indices extended their gains, with the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 hitting fresh record highs as high-growth tech firms continued to shine ahead of upcoming corporate earnings releases.
Netflix (NASDAQ:
NFLX
) is reporting results today after the closing bell, while tomorrow it will be Teslas turn. Apart from earnings announcements, on Thursday, Wall Street investors will also have to digest the first estimate of the US GDP data for Q4, ahead of next weeks FOMC decision.
Gold rebounded today, perhaps benefiting from the dollars slide. That said, with investors notably reducing their bets regarding a March Fed rate cut, it may be hard for todays rebound to evolve into something bigger if Thursdays GDP data and next weeks gathering prompt participants to further push back their rate cut expectations.
In the energy world, oil prices gained yesterday on supply concerns after a Ukrainian drone hit Russias Novatek fuel terminal, forcing it to suspend some operations, at a time when extreme cold weather in the US continues to hold back crude production."
Investing.com,"Gold May Drop Below 2,020 on Hawkish Fed; Euro Continues to Rise Ahead of ECB",2024-01-23,0.666667,"On Monday, the gold (XAU) price declined as market participants' expectations of a US interest rate cut in March decreased.Robust growth in equity markets further diminished the appeal of gold as a safe-haven asset. Jim Wyckoff, a senior analyst at Kitco Metals, pointed out that technical selling coupled with a surge in stock markets are probably the main factors restraining purchasing gold and silver. 'We have had better US economic data lately that suggests the Fed may have to hold off longer on lowering interest rates,' he said. Elevated interest rates also increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.Gold decreased by around 1% last week, having the most significant weekly dip in 6 weeks, following the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) hawkish comments. Officials said they need to consider more inflation data before deciding on rate cuts, hinting at Q3 as the earliest point for rate reductions. According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, the market suggests approximately a 43.5% probability of the rate cut in March, decreasing from 70% at the beginning of the previous week.XAU/USD
recovered from yesterday's decline during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the volatility will remain muted as the economic calendar is uneventful. However, any unforeseen geopolitical developments may affect the price of gold. 'Spot gold may retest support of $2,016 per ounce, as it could have completed a bounce from $2,001.72,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.The euro (EUR) didn't change much on Monday as traders continued to wait for the European Central Bank's (ECB) interest rate decision.The ECB will announce its monetary policy updates at 1:15 p.m. UTC on 25 January. Most economists polled by Reuters expect the central bank to leave its refinancing rate at 4.50% and deposit rate at 4.0%. However, the regulator will probably provide important forward guidance, outlining the euro's possible direction in the near term. Overall, the ECB doesn't look ready to begin butting interest rates: headline inflation remains above the official 2% target, while tensions in the Red Sea pushed cost inflation higher due to rising freight rates.Now, the market is pricing in roughly 125 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts from the ECB by the end of 2024, with the first cut in March or April. If the ECB makes any hawkish comments and investors dial back their expectations for rate cuts,
EUR/USD
may rally above 1.09400. Investors now see the Federal Reserve (Fed) to be more dovish, with 135 bps rate cuts in 2024, than the ECB, so the divergence in monetary policies favors the euro.EUR/USD was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, US reports may affect the pair's exchange rate. Specifically, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index publication at 3:00 p.m. UTC could shift investors' expectations regarding US monetary policy. If the figures are better than expected, EUR/USD may decline slightly, probably towards 1.08800. Otherwise, the pair may rally towards 1.09300 on weak economic data.The Australian dollar (AUD) lost 0.41% on Monday as the
US Dollar Index
(DXY) strengthened on decreasing expectations for an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) in March.Despite having losses yesterday,
AUD/USD
remains within a short-term bullish trend. Investors now consider the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) one of the least dovish central banks among G10 countries. The market believes the RBA will lag in shifting the monetary policy towards a dovish one. In fact, markets think the RBA won't cut interest rates until September, with only 36 basis points (bps) rate cuts this year. At the same time, the US economy's resilience may force the Fed to postpone rate reductions, putting bearish pressure on AUD/USD. Still, the short-term technical bias remains bullish as the AUD remains above the important intraday level of 0.65650.AUD/USD was rising during the Asian and early European sessions. Today, traders should focus on 2 events: the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index at 3:00 p.m. UTC and Australias's Judo Bank Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) due at 10:00 p.m. UTC. Both reports can impact investors' interest rate expectations."
Investing.com,Central Banks Overview,2024-01-23,0.333333,"Relative monetary policy drives currencies' exchange rates. Therefore, traders concentrate and take notes whenever a major central bank is due to announce its policy rate decision. Next week, two central banks, the Bank of Canada (BoC), and the European Central Bank (ECB)will declare their verdict on interest rates in the span of less than 72 hours. Their decisions, announcements, and subsequent press conferences will be closely watched by traders and investors alike. Overall, the market assumes that the rate-hiking cycle is over and that global central banks will embark on an aggressive easing campaign this year. However, the most ardent doves are likely to be disappointed. Octa offers a brief overview of what to expect.BoC's rate decision will be announced at 3:00 p.m. UTC on 24 January. The market expects BoC to leave its overnight rate steady at 5%. However, the central bank is unlikely to sound dovish because inflation remains elevated due to high growth in Canadian wages and shelter costs. According to the official data, annual inflation in Canada rose to 3.4% in December from 3.1% in November, making investors scale back their expectations for an early interest rate cut. During the press conference, Governor Tiff Macklem will probably attempt to strike a cautiously hawkish balance, underlying inflation concerns and acknowledging an economic slowdown.Overall, the BoC is probably the least dovish of the three central banks that will be updating their policy statements this week. A slower move to rate cuts could help support the Canadian dollar. Although
USD/CAD
has recently rallied to a one-month high, it faces stiff resistance in the 1.35500-1.36000 area. Should BoC deliver a hawkish statement, the long-term bearish trend in USD/CAD may resume, potentially targeting the 1.34000 level. As of right now, the market is pricing in roughly 100 basis points worth of rate cuts by the end of 2024, with the first cut widely anticipated in April.The ECB will issue its monetary policy updates at 1:15 p.m. UTC on 25 January. The majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the central bank to leave its refinancing rate at 4.50% and deposit rate at 4.0%. The signals from the ECB have been rather mixed lately. In fact, contradictory statements from the officials have made it more difficult for traders to assess the sentiment inside the ECB and project the future path of interest rates. As a result, investors' interest rate expectations have been moving sharply in recent weeks, causing volatile price action in EUR pairs.Overall, the ECB does not look like it is ready to deliver a rate cut. Headline inflation remains above the official 2.0% target, while tensions in the Red Sea have pushed cost inflation higher due to rising freight rates. The most likely scenario is for the ECB to leave its monetary policy unchanged and clarify its stance on future rate cuts. As of right now, the market is pricing in roughly 130 basis points worth of rate cuts by the end of 2024, with the first cut widely anticipated in either March or April. If, indeed, the ECB decides to cool off the investors and make them dial back their expectations for a rate cut,
EUR/USD
may rally back above 1.09300."
Investing.com,How to Know If We Are Heading for a Depression - And How to Prepare for It,2024-01-23,0.666667,"Just to remind you, a few weeks ago, I wrote an article which outlined the potential for a major bear market lasting between 13 and 21 years. In fact, this may even cause a long-term depression. And, there were many comments to that article whichmostly took objection to my view, which I categorized under the following 6 sections.The first four sections have been addressed inthe articles I published over the last two weeks.2 Common Misconceptions About Long-Term Bear MarketsHow Long Can the Fed Keep Saving Us From a Deep, Long-Term Correction?This week, I will address sections 5 and 6.Since we are dealing with financial markets, which are non-linear and uncertain environments, I want to make it clear upfront that a depression is obviously not a foregone conclusion.Therefore, I will end this series of articles outlining what I will need to see over the coming two years to tell me whether we are indeed heading into a 13-21 year bear market. And, if the market takes the path I lay out over the coming two years, then it will make a long-term bear market a high probability.Until such time, I am going to be taking my cues from the market action week by week and month by month, and will not likely take on an extreme bearish posture until I see strong confirmation in the next year or two. But, I will likely be raising a lot of cash in the coming months.With the market rallying strongly off the 4100SPX region struck this past October, we have seen a virtual straight lineup during this rally. And, it has converted many to not only a bullish view of the market, but with some even taking an extraordinarily bullish view of the market. In fact, the market action for the last decade reinforces the Pavlovian manner in which investors now believe that the market will ""always comes back."" I think the following comment I read likely summarizes most people's thinking about the market:It is also quite likely that many of you maintain the same perspective of the market. I mean, why would you not? If you look at the last 100 years in the market from a linear perspective, that really is the logical conclusion. However, the market is not a linear environment.You see, these last 100 years have been what we Elliotticians view as a 3rd wave. And, it is quite a large degree 3rd wave at that, as it began in 1932. However, once a 3rd wave completes, it leads to a 4th wave.Let's look at the last 100 years in the
SPX
in a chart created by Garrett Patten at Elliottwavetrader. As you can see, not only are we likely in the final stages of a 5-wave structure off the 1932 wave [II] low, we are also completing a 5-wave structure off the March 2009 low. And, as you can also see from this chart, the 2000-2009 sideways action was the largest consolidation we have seen since we began this rally back in 1932.Please note that the 2000-2009 correction was a wave iv within this wave [III] rally. Therefore, it is of one lesser degree than the wave [IV] we expect to begin in the not-too-distant future. And, since the impending wave [IV] is of one larger degree, the reasonable expectation is that it should take longer than a 4th wave of a smaller degree. For this reason, I believe that the impending wave [IV] bear market will likely last at least 13 years.Yet, the market has trained all participants, in Pavlovian fashion, to expect what the commenter noted above: an 8% S&P return. While it may be true over the coming 50+ years, many investors may not have the ability to wait out the next 20+ years before the market begins to provide us with those returns again. That means there is potential for a bear market to last a full generation.What I find even more interesting of late is that the current bullish action since October of 2023 has not only turned many former bears bullish, but it is now resulting in some outlandish market predictions across the spectrum. This past week, Bank of America pronounced they foresee a secular bull market that could last through 2033. I even saw one article this past week suggesting how investors should be positioned on the long side for the next 40 years.What I also believe to be telling is the steady decline in interest for hedge funds. ""Hedge funds are dead as a doornail,"" said Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder of ultra-high-net-worth investing club Tiger 21. ""Hedge funds have had a secular decline over the last decade because our members who wanted that exposure found that they could get it cheaper and better, less fees with the indexes or go direct with private equity.""Consider how sentiment works. More and more people believe that they can do better on their own simply because of the same perspective expressed in the comment I cited above. This type of hubris is really a result of bullish sentiment. I think this only adds to a reasonable expectation of a major top approaching. Of course, this is anecdotal, but it certainly supports the premise outlined in our long-term analysis view of the stock market.I want to again note that I am not writing this article from the perspective of a perma-bear. I am the same person who suggested investors go long in early 2016 at 1800SPX with expectations that we will rally to 2600+ ""no matter who wins the election.""I am the same person who suggested investors go long at 2200SPX with expectations at the time that we will exceed 4000SPX. I am also the same person who viewed the 3500SPX region as a bottom in October of 2022, with expectations of a rally to at least the 4300-4500SPX region (with potential to get to 5000+). I am far from a perma-bear. My goal is to view the market as objectively as humanly possible.But, in viewing the market objectively, I am seeing the strong potential of not only completing a 5-wave structure off the March 2022 low, and a larger 5-wave structure off the 2020 low, and an even larger 5-wave structure off the March 2009 low, but actually completing a very long term 5-wave structure off the 1932 low. And, when a 5-wave structure completes, we see the market turn in the opposite direction. Since we are completing a very long-term 5-wave structure, it is reasonable to expect a very long-term correction to take hold thereafter.So, of course, it brings us to our next question:6- How does one approach investing during a long-term bear market?Allow me to show you a more zoomed-in perspective on a monthly chart of the SPX.As you can see, we are now moving into a major topping box, which has been on my chart for many years. But, simply because we are now approaching what I view as a major market top potential does not necessarily provide me with confirmation that a major market top is being struck. So, allow me to outline what I am looking for in market action in the coming year or two to confirm a long-term bear market has likely begun.First, I want to note that the rally off the October 2022 low seems to be taking shape as something we call an ""ending diagonal."" What we know of ending diagonals is that once they complete, they strongly reverse back to the region from which they began. In our case, it would mean a strong reversal back down to the 3500-3800SPX region. Should we see that in the coming year or so, that would be our first step in the confirmation process.Thereafter, if the market should rally off that support in a very corrective and overlapping manner back to the 4600-4800SPX region, that would be the second point of confirmation for me. This would lead me to the expectation that a crash will likely develop after that rally to 4600-4800SPX completes, which would likely be the first of several crashes of differing degrees I would expect over the coming long-term bear market.As I mentioned in a prior article, Elliott outlined something he referred to as the ""Theory of Alternation."" In basic terms, it suggested that 2nd wave and 4th wave corrections alternate in their size, shape and length.Since the relative wave [II] was a sharp crash-like decline which was relatively short as it lasted from 1929-1932, I would expect this wave [IV] to be a much more protracted and tortuous structure. So, as you can see on my monthly chart, I am expecting a number of multi-year declines and rallies as we move through this long-term bear market.Now, I know the hallmark of many investors' plans focus upon dividend investing. That is because we have been enjoying a multi-decade bull market for the most part since 1932.However, should we move into a long-term bear market as I expect, it will likely result in economic conditions during which many companies will be forced to cut dividends, with some even ceasing their payments entirely in order to simply survive.We have been even seeing it begin recently and we have yet to even turn into the bear market just yet. And, in fact, many companies may not even survive. So, as a dividend investor, not only will your income potentially be cut, but so will your underlying capital investment.As for me personally, I will likely be approaching the market in phases. Should the market provide me with the bear market confirmation as I outlined above, I will likely be raising a significant amount of cash (likely over 70% - depending upon the positioning of the various charts we track throughout the market) before we begin the decline I would expect in the [c] wave of the a-wave on the monthly chart. Since [c] waves usually take shape as a 5-wave structure and are considered to be crash waves, I would re-invest my cash holdings as we are approaching the conclusion of that 5-wave [c] wave.Just to give you a bit of historical perspective, both the Covid Crash and the 2008 Financial Crisis were [c] waves of a larger degree. And, both provided recognizable investing opportunities as those [c] waves were completing. In fact, for those following my public analysis, you may remember my urging investors to move back into the market as the SPX was approaching the 2200SPX region, with an expectation that we rally from there to 4000+.Should the market then rally in a multi-year corrective structure, I would likely then again raise cash as we approach the conclusion of the b-wave on the monthly chart, in preparation for what would likely be the largest crash seen in modern history in the c-wave of the larger degree wave [IV]. And, when that crash completes its 5-wave structure to the downside, that will likely be a generational investing opportunity for investors, quite similar to the opportunity seen at the lows in 1932, but not quite to the same degree of upside expectation.So, while many do not like to hold cash, I will personally view it as a necessity as its relative value will rise significantly during those downturns in the markets and provide you with tremendous relative buying power at the various lows.Therefore, I strongly urge you to seek out the safest banks you can find to store your hard-earned cash. And, I also strongly urge you to do your own due diligence regarding the banks in which you currently store your cash.Moreover, for those who believe you may be able to hide-out in bonds or precious metals, the current manner in which those charts are setting up seem to suggest that the precious metals will also enter into a bear market at the same time, whereas the bond market may be setting up to crash along-side the equity market.Again, I want to reiterate that I do not believe markets are linear environments. Therefore, I believe one should utilize a non-linear analysis methodology in order to form objective and reasonable future expectations, which has served me quite well for decades on both the upside and downside shifts in the market during that time.It had me out of the market before the 2008 financial crisis, as well as out of the market before the Covid Crash. I plan on approaching the market in the same manner in the coming decade, of course, only after I receive the confirmation I noted above that a long-term bear market is likely taking shape.By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.

Investing.com,Q4 GDP Report Expected to Show US Growth Slowdown,2024-01-24,0.555556,"The Bureau of Economic Analysis appears set to report tomorrow (Jan. 25) that US output slowed sharply in the fourth quarter after Q3s unusually strong gain.But Thursdays
GDP
report is also expected to show that growth was moderate in the final three months of 2023  news that will support the soft landing view thats been popular with some economists.Q4 growth is on track to rise 2.0% (seasonally adjusted annual rate), based on todays median estimate for a set of nowcasts compiled by CapitalSpectator.com. The estimate contrasts with Q3s sharply higher 4.9% increase.Todays 2.0% nowcast also marks a slightly higher estimate compared with
last weeks run of the numbers
.The relatively steady nowcasts on these pages in the 1.5%-to-2.0% range over the past month or so lend support for assigning a high-confidence view that tomorrows report will reveal a hefty slowdown in Q4 that falls into the category of a soft-landing scenario.Economists overall seem to agree. Econodays consensus point forecast for tomorrows GDP release is also a 2.0% increase.Robust consumer spending is expected to be a key reason for resilient growth in Q4.Personal consumption expenditures
is forecast to rise at an annual 2.5% pace, well down from Q3s 3.1% gain, according to Econodays poll.But that still reflects robust consumption, which will help keep the economy humming via the Q4 profile."
Investing.com,Gold Continues to Move Sideways; Euro May Face Increased Volatility on PMI Data,2024-01-24,0.333333,"In the absence of any major macroeconomic reports from the US, the gold (XAU) price continued to rise on Tuesday, gaining 0.38%.Investors remain undecisive as they wait for a string of US economic data releases this week to get more cues on the Federal Reserve's (Fed) plans on monetary policy. As a result, the market stays relatively quiet, and traders' activity remains subdued. 'The gold market is just above the $2,000 mark, and it seems to be a neutral market. Every time we start to break higher, we come back down. There is a lot of uncertainty on what is going to happen here economically in the United States,' said Daniel Pavilonis, a senior market strategist at RJO Futures. Still, an interest rate cut in Q1, which would push
XAU/USD
higher, is possible. Traders price in a roughly 50% chance of a 25 basis-point cut in March, according to the CME FedWatch tool. However, Fed officials said last week that the US central bank needs more inflation data before deciding on the interest rate path.XAU/USD was falling slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders will focus on a series of S&P Global's Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) reports from around the world. The US PMI will be released at 2:45 p.m. UTC. If the figures are higher than expected, investors may finally stop expecting a rate cut in Q1, bringing XAU/USD down, possibly below 2,000. Lower-than-expected PMIs will reveal that the US economy is slowing, so the rate cut will probably be warranted. In this case, the price of gold may grow towards 2,035.The euro (EUR) fluctuated in a 1.082001.09100 range and lost 0.28% in a volatile trading session on Tuesday.Even though Richmond Manufacturing Index numbers were lower than expected, the
US Dollar Index
(DXY) continued to trade near a 6-month high yesterday. It seems that investors are beginning to realize that the Federal Reserve (Fed) won't rush to cut interest rates in Q1. The probability of a 25 basis-point (bps) rate reduction in March has dropped below 50%, according to the latest interest rate swap market data.At the same time, the outlook for the eurozone's economy remains murky. Yesterday, the European Commission said consumer confidence fell below expectations, suggesting that European businesses continue struggling amid low consumer spending. The European Central Bank (ECB) will announce its interest rate decision on Thursday, but it's unlikely to sound hawkish as the economy continues to underperform. However, investors still believe the ECB will be less dovish than the Fed in 2024. They price in roughly 130 bps worth of rate cuts from the ECB and 140 bps of cuts from the Fed by the end of 2024.EUR/USD
was relatively unchanged during the Asian trading session but started to rise slightly in the European session. Today, EUR/USD traders may face substantial volatility as S&P Global releases its Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) for the eurozone at 9:00 a.m. UTC and for the US at 2:45 p.m. UTC. The PMI is a leading indicator of the economy's health and serves as a proxy for changes in business activity and inflation. Therefore, higher-than-expected PMIs will have a bullish impact on the nation's currency, whereas weak data may pull currencies down.Yesterday, despite increased spreads between gilt and Treasury yields, the British pound (GBP) decreased by 0.35%. However, the currency stayed above the lows of late December and January, near the 1.2600 mark.Since the middle of December 2023,
GBP/USD
has been trading sideways within 1.260001.28000. Next week, the Bank of England (BOE) will announce its interest rate decision. Recent weaker-than-expected data on industrial production and retail sales suggested it may be time for the BOE to consider decreasing the interest rate, which is now at its highest point in nearly 16 years. While economists in a Reuters poll don't foresee an immediate cut on 1 February, the majority anticipate one by mid-2024.Overall, the market is currently pricing in roughly 90 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts in 2024. The BOE, criticized for its initial slow response to rising inflation, now sees inflation dropping to 2% soon, faster than earlier forecasts. However, factors like a potential fiscal stimulus from the government budget may prompt the regulator to maintain a cautious approach to reducing borrowing costs.Today, GBP/USD rose above 1.2700, recovering slightly after experiencing a 0.18% drop overnight. Today, U.K. S&P Global's Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) will be released at 9:30 a.m. UTC. If the composite PMI figure is lower than expected, GBP/USD may fall below 1.26500. Otherwise, strong data may support the long-term bullish trend in GBP."

Investing.com,Housing Market Recovery Tests Fed's Inflation Progress as M2 Turns Higher,2024-01-24,0.666667,"One of the successes the Federal Reserve can tout from the last couple of years (and the list of them is pretty short, to be fair) is that after the unprecedented policy actions during COVID caused never-before-seen rates of money supply expansion, subsequent policy avoided normalizing that explosion.Year-over-year growth in M2 reached 26.9%. But in 2022, as the Fed started hiking rates and shrinking its balance sheet, the rate of growth slowed until M2 reached its absolute peak in July 2022 and began to slowly decline.As of todays H6 release, year-over-year M2 has been negative for 13 months in a row.To be sure, after a massive explosion, the
level
of M2 has not declined all that far as the chart below shows.I also documented this fact back in November in 
Where Inflation Stands in the Cycle
, which was a good piece. You should read it.So the success of the Fed here can be summarized by saying, that at least they didnt keep blowing up the money supply.Since the rise in prices is clearly and closely related to the explosion in the quantity of money we have seen (anyone who still resists this obvious truism after the mountain of recent evidence is added to the prior mountain of evidence), this was a
sine qua non
for getting
inflation
back down.It isnt
sufficient
unless its continued for a very long time, but its
necessary
. As I illustrated in that article linked above (which you should read), there are several ways that inflation could evolve from here as the shock to the system gradually unwinds.Ive talked before about how velocity in the policy crisis behaved as a spring or a capacitor, absorbing a lot of monetary energy that is doomed to be released back into the system.Velocity is still rebounding (in Q4, if forecasts for Thursdays Advance
GDP
report are accurate, it will rise something like 4% annualized), but if money growth remains negative then thats the least painful way this can resolve.In the last chart from that prior article (have I mentioned its worth reading?), slack money growth with decent growth and rebounding velocity is reflected in a movement mostly to the left, with the price level not rising much. Good outcome.However, that outcome is
predicated
on the notion that the money supply remains slack.If M2 starts to rise again, then the curve drifts upward and the potential set of outcomes almost certainly involves higher prices. Naturally, Im mentioning this because of developments that make me concerned about this score.One thing that I seriously missed in 2022 was the fact that the increase in interest rates helped bring down money supply growth.Thats not at all intuitive, because in general changing the price of a loan tends not to change the demand for a loan by very much  especially when higher inflation is making the spot
real
interest rate paid by the borrower lower and lower.In other words, I assert with some decent evidence that consumer and industrial loan demand is somewhat inelastic for modest changes in interest rates.Ergo, I believed that merely raising interest rates would not necessarily cause money growth to decelerate.As it happened, I was saved from my own mistake by the fact that the Fed was also shrinking the balance sheet, which (even though reserve balances arent binding on banks in the current environment, so they are essentially unconstrained in lending) I thought
might
help money growth to decelerate.Not that I thought wed keep getting 20% growth, but I didnt think we would have naturally seen money growth fall below, say, 5%.Fortunately, because the Fed was also shrinking the balance sheet my forecasts were not drastically
inaccurate
despite being wrongly inspired, and so I forecast 5.1% median inflation for 2023 and we got 5.06%. Its nice when the ball actually bounces your way.As it happens, though, for the most part, higher interest rates seem to have
not
affected loan growth very much. C&I loan growth remained strong throughout 2022 and didnt start to level off until the Fed was just about through tightening, and consumer loans as I expected only started to level off when the
Unemployment Rate
started to risecredit cards, not at all.And thats because, as I said, most borrowers are not borrowing because they made an NPV calculation that said borrowing makes sense; theyre borrowing because they need to and 1% or 2% or 3% doesnt change that calculus very much.But you know where it did change the calculus a lot? In mortgages. Thats because a buyer might be
reluctant
to pay 1% more on a mortgage, but what the buyer also needs is someone willing to abandon their awesome loan.As has been noted elsewhere by lots of people, home sales cratered not because people werent wanting to buy but because there werent enough people who wanted to sell.So mortgage origination volumes also dried up, as a direct consequence of higher rates. The one large market where interest rates did have a big impact, although not for the reason youd think, was in mortgages!You know I wouldnt say this unless I had a neat chart to show you. Here is the Mortgage Bankers Association Purchase index, tracking the volume of new loans for purchasing a home (in black), set against y/y money supply growth, in blue.Lets tie this up with a bow:And what should you do about it,
just in case
? For starters, read Inflation Sherpa."
Investing.com,Global Markets Update,2024-01-24,0.666667,"Netflix (NASDAQ:
NFLX
) jumped 8% in the after-hours trading as its revenue and new subscriptions topped estimates. More than 13 million people decided that Netflix was worth paying for, and the number of total paid subscribers rose past 260 million. The password-sharing ban has been a boon for the company. The only thing they regret is not having thought about it before.Strong Netflix results will likely give a positive spin to the major US indices which were slow to move yesterday after the Richmond manufacturing index came in much lower than expected.In the sovereign space, a mixed
2-year
bond auction in the US hinted at declining optimism from the Federal Reserves (Fed) dovish camp, but a jump from foreign buyers pulled the US 2-year yield lower. The
10-year
yield remains steady above 4.10% and will hopefully cross back above the 2-year yield after having stayed inverted for more than a year-and-a-half as the US soft-landing scenario is given more weight despite the slow manufacturing numbers as US consumer spending remains strong and helps to keep the US economy afloat. The US will release its latest GDP update tomorrow and is expected to print a decent 2% growth for the last quarter.Robust US economic growth, strong earnings, and prospects of lower Fed rates remain supportive of equity valuations, although the ATH levels and near-overbought market conditions in the
S&P 500
call for  at least  a minor correction in the short run. Today, Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) will be reporting its latest Q4 results after the bell, and the results will unlikely be as enchanting as Netflix. But overall, investors dont want to miss the US stocks rally to fresh highs. And if the trend is your friend, well, the trend is clearly positive.In China, though, sentiment is the exact opposite. Chinese stocks saw a little bump yesterday on the announcement of a $278bn rescue package to lift the Chinese stocks up. But skepticism reigned as 1. the rescue package was found to be a bit meager compared with around $6 trillion of market value wiped off the value of Chinese and Hong Kong stocks in the past 3 years. 2. The rescue package doesnt solve the underlying fundamental problems, namely slowing economic growth, a serious property crisis, and a slowing population. And 3. No one can guarantee a consistent action plan from the Xi government in the medium to long run. The ruthless government crackdown and extreme COVID measures are responsible for a severe confidence loss. And the market reaction to Chinese measures proves that you cant buy confidence.In the FX, the
US Dollar Index
is testing the 200-DMA to the upside. Parallelly, the
EUR/USD
is testing its 200-DMA support to the downside. Todays PMI data and tomorrows European Central Bank (ECB) decision will likely help provide fresh direction to the pair. Fading inflation, sputtering European economies, and ECB Chief Lagardes latest words in Davos hint that the ECB is preparing for a summer rate cut. More clarity on the ECBs rate cut plans could provide a green light for a sustainable move below the 200-DMA. Elsewhere, the Bank of Canada (BoC) meets today and is expected to maintain rates unchanged. The
Loonie
remains under the pressure of a limited appetite for oil.Speaking of
oil
, US crudes inability to clear the $75pb offers is intriguing despite news that would normally be positive for oil prices  like the geopolitical tensions in regions where oil is pumped and transported, and the US API data showing a 6.7-million barrel slump in weekly oil inventories. The next decisive move in oil prices should be a positive breakout."

With the US economy showing resilience and central bank officials expressing caution in cutting interest rates, some investors are reassessing their expectations of the pace of the Fed's rate cuts this year. High-interest rates generally increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets, like bullion. The CME's FedWatch tool indicates that markets believe the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at its 30  31 January policy meeting. Also, investors' expectations of the rate cut have shifted from March to May.XAU/USD
was relatively flat during the Asian and early European sessions. Today, traders should monitor the US GDP Growth Rate report at 1:30 p.m. UTC. If the figures are lower than expected, XAU/USD will likely increase towards 2,025. However, the downward trend in gold could persist if numbers exceed the forecast.The euro (EUR) surged to a 9-day high on Wednesday but later lost most of the gains and settled below the pivotal 1.09000 level.Yesterday's purchasing managers' survey, conducted by S&P Global, showed that the eurozone's businesses continue to struggle as activity contracted again in January due to falling demand. Meanwhile, price pressure rose as a result of escalating tensions in the Red Sea. Although the manufacturing figures improved somewhat, a steep decline in the services sector brought the composite index down.Indeed, recession risk is the primary reason investors expect the ECB to cut interest rates this year. The market is currently pricing in roughly 130 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts in 2024, with the first 25 bps reduction in April.EUR/USD
was declining slightly during the Asian and European trading sessions. Today, the main event is the ECB's interest rate decision and its monetary policy statement at 1:15 p.m. UTC. In addition, ECB President Christine Lagarde may provide some forward guidance during the press conference, which will be held at 1:45 p.m. UTC. The regulator is facing tough choices. On the one hand, the economy continues to underperform, pushing the bank to make an early interest rate cut. On the other hand, inflation has yet to be fully defeated, while trade route disruptions in the Red Sea are pushing up consumer prices. Overall, the ECB will most likely keep interest rates unchanged at a record high. Still, the ECB probably views recession as a bigger threat to stability than inflation. Thus, it may adopt a dovish tone, likely pushing EUR/USD lower towards key levels of 1.08300 and 1.08950.The Japanese yen (JPY) gained almost 0.6% on Thursday as US dollar bulls took profit after the
USD/JPY
failed to break above the important 148.800 resistance level.USD/JPY has been trading in a tight range over the past week as traders juxtapose the latest Bank of Japan (BOJ) policy rate decision with the upbeat macroeconomic reports from the US Overall, investors' interest rate expectations have turned more hawkish, both for the BOJ and the Federal Reserve (Fed). Currently, interest rate swap market data indicates that traders are pricing in roughly 130 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts from the Fed and 20 bps rate increases from the BOJ by the end of 2024. In absolute terms, these interest rate expectations support the US dollar compared to the Japanese yen. However, the divergence in monetary policy is turning less bullish for the USD/JPY, especially given that the pair is trading near historical highs. Thus, USD/JPY may eventually drop below 146.000, particularly if the US macroeconomic data disappoints investors or Japanese data starts to exceed expectations.USD/JPY may rise slightly in the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today's main event for traders is the US Gross Domestic Product Growth report at 1:30 p.m. UTC. The report will come out simultaneously with other less critical but important releases: Durable Goods Orders and Jobless Claims. These reports may provoke substantial volatility in the market. Better-than-expected figures may have a minor bullish impact on USD/JPY as traders are already positioned on the long side. Otherwise, weak data may trigger a large sell-off in USD/JPY, bringing the pair towards the 146.00 level."
Investing.com,Stock Market Rally Sputters Amid Bond Auction Jitters,2024-01-25,0.222222,"Stocks finished higher, with the
S&P 500
climbing by 0.08% on the day. Yesterday was not boring. It was very interesting and exciting in some ways to see how things are coming together, as I noted in yesterdays video to members.You could see these mild changes happening in the volatility space of the market, most notably in the 1-month Implied Correlation index and the volatility space.After starting the day lower, the 1-month implied correlation index rose by around 5%. Around 10:15 AM ET, this started to creep higher, even as the S&P 500 was rallying, and climbed higher by as much as 80 bps at one point during the day.Typically, on an up day in the index, this implied correlation index should go in the opposite direction of the equity market.Also, the 1-month implied correlation index was already trading on par with the July lows and the lows seen in January 2018 and the fall of 2018.All of which marked important price tops in the market. It hasnt always marked the peak in the market before a major sell-off, but this seems to be similar to that 2017-2018 time frame.This is the second time it has gotten this low in about seven months compared to the January 2018 and October 2018 versions.The second clue was that the IV was rising, which was noted most easily by the
VIX
, which started to climb higher around 10:30 AM.The Bank of Canadas rate
decision
aided this. It left rates unchanged and lowered the countrys growth and inflation outlook.That led to a big rally in the
USD/CAD
pair, which probably helped to push the VIX higher, given their historical relationship.The final straw was the
5-year
auction, which did not go well and saw indirect participation fall to just 60.9% from 70.6% last month and had a tail of around two bps yesterday, with a weak bid-to-cover ratio.It pushed the
10-year
up by more than four bps on the day, 4.18%.It all came together to reverse an 80 bps gain in the S&P 500 to just an eight bps gain. We will see what today brings.Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) reported some ugly
results
, missing earnings, revenues, and gross margins. To make it worse, it took out the 50% average compounded annual volume growth rate language in its investor deck.I think that is a really big deal, and I know that when I owned the stock, what got me to sell it was that I realized at some point that language needed to come out, and I wanted to be nowhere near this when it did.The stock is only down 2%. Either the stock is waiting to find out more on the call, or the big level of put gamma at $200 is supporting it. There isnt much gamma there, so once it burns itself out there is not going to be much holding it up.The Free YouTube Video:Original Post"
Investing.com,When Do You Start to Worry About Chinese Stimulus?,2024-01-25,0.666667,"The stock rally continued on both sides of the Atlantic on Wednesday; the technology and chip stocks remained in the driver's seat. Sentiment in Europe was bolstered by an almost 9% rally in ASML on news that their orders more than tripled last quarter. Now, there is a catch. A third of the $10 billion dollar worth of orders came from China as Chinese companies rushed to buy these machines by the end of last year before the US and Dutch chip ban came into effect. But even if the Chinese demand will fade away, ASML says that it expects its sales to remain steady thanks to AI demand.As such, the ASML news also boosted the stock prices of our favorite AI plays. Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) hit another record yesterday, TSM extended gains, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
) was worth $3 trillion for some time. The
S&P500
and
Nasdaq 100
hit a fresh record, and Netflix (NASDAQ:
NFLX
)  which has nothing to do with AI, but which was just cheering its 13-mio new subscribers for the latest quarter - jumped 10%.In summary, all goes well for those who are in the technology boat sailing north. For the rest, skepticism best describes how they feel about an unsustainable rise in valuations.Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) missed estimates in its latest quarterly earnings report and warned that its EV sales growth will be notably lower and that the numbers will suffer until the company comes up with a cheaper model. The series of price cuts wasnt enough to bolster demand in a way to keep the company smiling and profits rising  sufficiently. As such, Tesla refused to offer a specific growth target and its share price took a 6% hit in the after-hours trading. Intel (NASDAQ:
INTC
) is due to report its earnings today.The Chinese are serious about bolstering their economy and they look like they are getting to a place where they are ready to do whatever it takes to reverse the slowing trend.In addition to a series of market stimulus news, the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) announced yesterday that it will cut the reserve ratio for the banks by 50bp from February to release more liquidity to bolster stock valuations The latter will free up to an additional trillion yuan, which equals $139bn
US dollars
.Will it help? Well, we will see. The good news is, if it doesnt, the Chinese will continue until it does.The CSI 300 finally sees some positive reaction, stocks in Hong Kong are up 10% since Monday, American crude is drilling above the $75pb per barrel and
copper futures
 which are a gauge of global growth  also seem gently convinced that the Chinese will put all their weight  all they need to  to make things better.But note that Chinas supportive policies may not echo well across the developed markets central banks, because the Chinese stimulus  if successful  should boost global inflation and interfere with DM central banks plans to loosen policies.But until we see concrete results from Chinese measures, softer policies remain the base-case scenario for the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the other major central banks (except Japan). In this context, the Bank of Canada (BoC) kept its rates unchanged at yesterdays meeting and called the end of rate hikes. The European Central Bank (ECB) will meet today and will certainly vehicle the same message - that policy tightening is over. But thats not enough.When it comes to the ECB, what investors want to know is When the ECB will start cutting the interest rates. If we had this conversation two weeks ago, I would say that the ECB would push back on expectations of premature rate cuts. But after having heard Christine Lagarde say that the first-rate cut could come in summer, I am more balanced going into the meeting. Inflation has come lower  but we saw an uptick in the latest figures. The rising shipping costs and the positive pressure in oil prices mean that upside risks prevail. Yet the slowdown in European economies calls for lower rates. Released yesterday, the Eurozone PMI figures showed that aggregate activity remained in the contraction zone for the 8th straight month and slowed down accelerated in January  except for manufacturing.A hedge fund called Qube apparently built a $1 bn short position against German stocks, and Goldman Sachs says that a Trump presidency would increase risks for European businesses, and economically sensitive pockets of the market, like the German industries, would be the most exposed."
Investing.com,3 Signs of Inflation to Watch Out For,2024-01-25,0.333333,"As a follow-up to a Daily, I wrote on January 7th,
this article
,
yesterdays January 23rd Daily was all about one of the 3 indicators that can get us prepared for more inflation.On January 7th
sugar
was still trading under 22 cents.Since then, SUGAR is up another 15%.A quote from yesterday:Most noteworthy is the notion of supercycles.Sugar is a great example of a 400% move higher since 2020, followed by a near 40% move lower. And currently, a 20% move up since it reached the nadir of 20.00.Volatility-yes-the inherent nature of a super cycle.The second indicator I wrote about on January 7th is how
Silver
does relative to
gold
.When silver begins to outperform gold, that is generally an inflationary sign.This is a good time to remind you that the chart of CPI overlaying the 1970s with current times lines up incredibly well. Has CPI troughed?With so many saying inflation is over, clearly, they have not been paying enough attention.Maybe now they will.Silver, for the second day in a row, is outperforming gold.The chart of March futures shows us that momentum could be just about to flash a mean reversion.Furthermore, $22.00 is a solid risk point with overhead resistance at $24.The 3rd sign is the
Dollar
and if it makes a more drastic move lower from its current rangebound price action.The dollar is wedged between the 50 (blue) and 200 (green) moving averages.We can hardly say that it is collapsing or giving us cause for major concern right now.Momentum is declining though. A move under the 50 and 200 MAs on our Real Motion indicator might raise some eyebrows.Especially if the price fails 102.This week we have PCE numbers coming out. That is a lagging and not a leading indicator.We can assume that the number will be subdued.This should give the FED room to discuss rate cuts for March.Hence, we can be patient on the inflation plays for now-but certainly not complacent."

Investing.com,Stock-To-Cash Ratios Suggest Very Little Buying Power for Investors at This Point,2024-01-26,0.666667,"As money market account balances soar, the mainstream media again proclaims,
There is $6 trillion of cash on the sidelines just waiting to come into the market.No? Well, here it is directly from YahooFinance:The surge in money markets since the
pandemic
has revived the age-old narrative that
money on the sidelines
is set to come into the markets. However, they dont tell you those funds have accumulated since 1974. Correctly, in the aftermath of crisis events, some of these assets rotate from
safety
to
risk,
but not the degree commentators suggest.Here is the problem with the cash on the sidelines reasoning:
it is a complete myth
.We have repeatedly discussed this myth, but it is worth repeating, particularly when the financial media begins to push the narrative to garner headlines.There is a superficial, glib appeal to the idea. After all, lots of people hold money on deposit at the bank, and they could use that money to buy stocks, right? After all, the latest financial data from the Office of Financial Research shows more than $6.3 Trillion sitting in money market accounts.So whats to prevent some of that money
coming into the market?Simple. The fallacy of composition.
This was the
point we made previously
:Furthermore, despite this very salient point, looking at the
stock-to-cash ratios
(cash as a percentage of investment portfolios)
also suggests very little buying power for investors. As shown in the chart from Sentimentrader.com, as asset prices have escalated, so have individuals appetite to chase risk. The current equity to money market asset ratio, although down from its record, is still above all pre-financial crisis peaks.If we look specifically at retail investors, their cash levels have been at the lowest level since 2014 and are not far from record lows. At the same time, equity allocations are not far from the levels in 2007.The same is valid with money market levels relative to the market capitalization of the
S&P 500
index. The ratio is currently near its lowest since 1980, which suggests that even if the cash did come into the market, it would not move the needle much.With net exposure to equity risk by individuals at very high levels it suggests two things:But it isnt just individual investors that are all in, but professionals as well.So, if retail and professional investors are already primarily allocated to equity exposure, with very little
cash on the sidelines,
who has all this cash?To understand who is holding all the cash currently in money market funds, we can break the
Office Of Financial Research
data down by category.There are a few things we need to consider about money market funds.The list goes on, but you get the idea.Furthermore, you will notice the bulk of the money is in Government Money Market funds. These particular types of money market funds often have much higher account minimums
(from $100,000 to $1 million),
suggesting these funds are
not
retail investors.
(Those would be the smaller balances of prime retail funds.)Of course, since the
Great Financial Crisis,
 one of the primary uses of corporate
cash on the sidelines
has been for share repurchases to boost earnings. As noted previously, as much as
40% of the bull market since 2012
can be attributed to share buybacks alone.As noted above, the stock market is always a function of buyers and sellers, each negotiating to make a transaction. While there is a
buyer for every seller, the question is always at
what price?In the current bull market, few people are willing to sell, so buyers must keep bidding up prices to attract a seller to make a transaction.
As long as this remains the case and exuberance exceeds logic, buyers will continue to pay higher prices to get into the positions they want to own.Such is the very definition of the
greater fool
theory.However, at some point, for whatever reason, this dynamic will change.
Buyers will become more scarce as they refuse to pay a higher price. When sellers realize the change, there will be a rush to sell to a diminishing pool of buyers. Eventually, sellers begin to
panic sell
as buyers evaporate and prices plunge.Sellers live higher. Buyers live lower.What causes that change? No one knows.But for now, we need to put the myth of
cash on the sidelines
to rest."
Investing.com,January Fed Meeting,2024-01-26,0.333333,"The FOMC meeting will take place on 3031 January 2024, some of the key dates traders mark on their calendars. The market expected the Fed to keep rates at 5.255.50%, but the FOMC has signaled several rate cuts throughout 2024 as inflation weakens and the economy slows. Octa explains what to expect.At the last FOMC meeting held on 1718 December 2023, interest rates remained unchanged at 5.25%5.50%. The quarterly released Summary of Economic Projections backed the December decision. According to the published data for 2024, GDP growth will move from 1.5% to 1.4%, unemployment will remain unchanged at 4.1%, and PCE inflation will decline from 2.5% to 2.4%. Based on this, FOMC members voted to change the key rate, which was reflected in the Fed's dot plot. For 2024, the Fed's median target rate is now 4.6% vs. 5.1% in Junedown 0.50 basis points.On the eve of the next FOMC meeting on 3031 January 2024, as many as three Fed representatives expressed their opinion. They made it clear that they have not yet seen evidence to start easing monetary policy: San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said during her Friday interview on Fox Business: Neither unemployment nor inflation makes me think that an adjustment is necessary. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic still anticipates the first rate cut won't be until the third quarter. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee also emphasizes the importance of getting more relevant data.The policymakers spoke just hours before the Fed's traditional pre-meeting communications blackout period. The market expected the Fed to keep rates steady at a target of 5.25%5.50%.Markets still see rates unchanged in January and predict a 48% probability of a rate cut at the next meeting in March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Traders should focus most of their attention on the rhetoric accompanying the decision. If Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signals a possible rate cut in March, the
US Dollar
will likely weaken against all major currencies.
USDJPY
may decline to the 140.00142.00 range by the end of this trading week."
Investing.com,Strong Q4 GDP Growth Shatters Recession Fears,2024-01-26,0.666667,"The only thing that was genuinely surprising in yesterdays
fourth-quarter report
on US economic activity was the strength of the increase.The positive directional bias, by contrast, has been relatively clear for weeks, if not longer. Assuming, of course, that you were analyzing a broad array of indicators and avoiding the rookie mistakes of estimating recession risk.For the perennial recession forecasters, the 3.3% rise in output in Q4 was the latest blow to ongoing warnings that trouble is just around the corner.The GDP advance beat expectations by a wide marginthe consensus forecast was 2%. Economic activity still slowed substantially from Q3, but the third quarters red-hot rise was an unsustainable upside outlier.Predicting or nowcasting GDP data points with precision is challenging, but the econometric tools for estimating recession risk in real-time, and in the near term, offer more traction.Unfortunately, the habit in the wider analytical and media worlds is to favor weak models and extreme headline-grabbing commentary. Fortunately, theres a better way.Once again, CapitalSpectator.coms modeling on estimating US recession risk has paid off.Par for the course. For much of the past nine months this modeling  updated and reviewed weekly in The US Business Cycle Risk Report  has indicated that an NBER-defined recession has been a low probability. Dumb luck? Unlikely.Why has this modeling been accurate when so much of the commentariat has incorrectly warned otherwise through most of 2023?The simple answer: crunching the numbers on a wide array of indicators and carefully reviewing and processing the results via multiple angles is substantially more effective than the usual routine of cherry-picking from so-called infallible recession predictors.At the core of this idea is a long-running empirical fact thats been verified in numerous studies and real-world experience over decades: combining forecasts/nowcasts from several sources  ideally reflecting different modeling techniques  yields better results.Last year was yet another master class of showing the power of ensemble models that carefully draw on multiple indicators and models.Consider, for example,
this highlight on CapitalSpectator.com from late-May 2023
, when an excerpt from The US Business Cycle Risk Report was highlighted on these pages, advising that recession risk remained low.A below-10% probability, based on the Composite Recession Risk Index (CRPI), which is calculated from 14-diversified economic and financial data sets.At the time, the recession forecasts were seemingly coming out of the woodwork. But a comprehensive review of the numbers never supported the dark outlook  a recurring theme via my modeling throughout 2023.The positive macro signaling also applied to proprietary modeling that cautiously looks into the near future  2-3 months, which is about as far as it goes for high-confidence forecasting of US business cycle risk.Meantime, the perennial recession forecasters never admit defeat. Instead, they keep moving their estimates of contraction forward until, eventually, theyre proven right.That may be a good strategy for publicity, but its a loser for investors and business owners trying to make sense of the business cycle outlook.Fortunately, theres a better way. On that front, the outlook is still upbeat. Heres the Jan. 21, 2024 estimate of CRPI from The US Business Cycle Risk Report:Meanwhile, the near-term modeling estimates for the Economic Trend Index (ETI) and Economic (EMI) project that the US economic bias will remain comfortably positive through February.(Note: ETI signals recession are defined as below 50% and EMI below 0% in the chart below).As new numbers are published, the real-time and ex-ante estimates are updated.Rather than trying to forecast 6 or 12 months ahead (a hopelessly impossible task), the core focus of The US Business Cycle Risk Report is to develop high-confidence estimates of recession risk right now, and for the very near term.Analysts are fooling themselves if they think they can reliably look much beyond that window.History shows this approach has been productive  not perfect, but relatively dependable.Indeed, Ive been running these models for well over a decade and theyve been the worst way to estimate recession risk  except when compared with everything else.The futures still uncertain, but for making informed macro risk estimates you could do a lot worse, as the quasi-religious order of perennial recession forecasters show us time and time again."
Investing.com,Euro/dollar loses ground after ECB and US GDP data,2024-01-26,0.444444,
Investing.com,Strong US Data Did Not Change Market Expectations,2024-01-26,0.666667,"America continues to release strong macro data, with a fresh batch of GDP andNew Home Sales figures coming above expectations, supporting
dollar
-buying interest late in the day.
The US economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the 4th quarter of 2023.Analysts, on average, had forecast a slowdown to 2.0% from 4.9% earlier. The economy added 3.1% to the same quarter last year. That's a healthy growth, one that the economy has seen in the second half of 2019 and before that during periods of robust expansion. With this kind of performance, the voices of those predicting an imminent recession are getting quieter.
At the same time, this rate of growth is not pushing up inflation, as has been the case in previous episodes. The GDP price index rose at a rate of 1.5%, much weaker than the 2.3% and 3.3% previously expected.
These data suggest that the economy is managing to combine the tightest monetary conditions in decades, healthy economic growth, and a downward trend in inflation.
As if that weren't enough, the New Home Sales showed an 8% m/m increase, largely reversing the previous month's 9% drop. The current pace of new home sales (664K annualized rate) is within the normal range for the three years since the start of 2017. Thus, the housing market does not appear to be a victim of decades high mortgage rates.Ultimately, the data did not affect expectations for a rate change in March, with the probability of a cut still close to 50%. The market will have to wait for more clarity from the Fed, which may not come until 31 January in the form of Powell's post-FOMC comments and press conference.
Such statistics could also have a positive impact on the equity market, pointing to strong domestic demand. However, the indices, which are close to historic highs, have come under investor scrutiny amid the corporate reporting season.

Investing.com,"Gold May Drop Below 2,000 on Fed Rate Cut Expectations; Euro Falls on Dovish ECB",2024-01-26,0.666667,"On Thursday, the gold (XAU) price rose, driven by a decline in US Treasury yields after Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a slowdown in inflation.However, gold is still on track for its second consecutive weekly decline, influenced by a strong
US dollar
and a resilient US economy. Official data revealed the US economy expanded more rapidly than anticipated in Q4, driven by robust consumer spending and reduced inflationary pressures. This week's GDP and S&P Global reports show that the US economy in January seems healthy.Nevertheless,
XAU/USD
managed to recover its losses and rose by 0.35% on Thursday as traders focused on easing inflation.He noted this scenario is proving to be beneficial for gold. Market participants have adjusted their interest rate cut expectations, pricing in a 92% probability for a rate cut in May.In the Asian and early European trading sessions, XAU/USD was relatively stable. Today, market participants await the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index report at 1:30 p.m. The Federal Reserve (Fed) uses the PCE data to measure the progress in achieving its 2% inflation target. If the core PCE figure is lower than the forecast, XAU/USD may rise above 2,030. However, better-than-expected data may deepen the bearish trend in gold.The euro (EUR) lost 0.34% on Thursday after the European Central Bank (ECB) left interest rate unchanged and made dovish remarks in its monetary policy statement.EUR/USD
experienced above-normal volatility in yesterday's trading session as investors digested the ECB's post-meeting statement. Also, ECB President Christine Lagarde's press conference and the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) added bearish pressure on the pair. The GDP report showed that the US economy grew faster than expected in Q4 due to strong consumer spending. Despite the Federal Reserve's (Fed) aggressive rate-hiking campaign, GDP expanded by a 3.3% annualized rate last quarter after advancing at a 4.9% pace in Q3. Still, the GDP report also showed easing inflation, and traders continued to price in a smaller chance for a rate cut in March while considering a 95% probability for a 25 basis point (bps) rate reduction in May.Meanwhile, the ECB left its refinancing rate at 4.50% and the deposit rate at 4.0%, as expected. However, in its monetary policy statement, the ECB expressed confidence that inflation is slowing and will continue to ease further. The market interpreted the message as a dovish signal, immediately leading to a sell-off in EUR/USD. 'Given the cautiously dovish tone of today's meeting, the risk of a cut before June has increased somewhat,' said Martin Wolburg, a senior economist at Generali (BIT:
GASI
) Investments.EUR/USD continued to decline slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, all eyes will be on the US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) report released at 1:30 p.m. UTC. If the core PCE Price Index is higher than expected, it will doubt the Fed's ability to cut interest rates in Q1, possibly pushing EUR/USD below 1.08000. Otherwise, lower figures would weaken the US dollar and may push EUR/USD above 1.08800.The
Australian dollar
(AUD) was essentially unchanged on Thursday, even though other major currencies experienced noticeable volatility due to the release of US macroeconomic reports.Australian stock exchanges and banks will be closed today due to Australia Day. Thus, the volatility may remain relatively low. Overall, AUD/USD has been trading in a narrow 0.652000.66150 range for over a week. Fundamentally, the divergence between Australian and US monetary policies still favors AUD. Now, the market anticipates more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (Fed) than from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). According to the latest interest rate swap market data, traders are currently pricing in only 40 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the RBA and 140 bps of cuts in the US by the end of 2024. Furthermore, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) recently announced it would keep the benchmark lending rate at a record low3.45%, which should continue to support China's economy and boost the demand for Australia's exports.AUD/USD was flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions due to the national holiday. Still, the pair may face heightened volatility in the American session when the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index report comes out at 1:30 p.m. UTC. The short-term technical bias remains bearish as the Australian dollar trades below the important intraday level of 0.66000. However, the picture might rapidly change if the PCE data surprises the market. Higher-than-expected numbers might bring AUD/USD below 0.65500, while lower-than-expected figures may push the pair above 0.66000, triggering a new bullish trend."
Investing.com,"US GDP Shines, Euro Weakens",2024-01-26,0.666667,"The
EUR/USD
traded south yesterday, as the European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Christine Lagarde reckoned that growth and inflation are slowing while insisting that the rate cut decision will be data dependent. The pair cleared the 200-DMA support, fell to 1.0820, its a little higher this morning, but we are now below the 200-DMA and the ECB rate cut bets on falling inflation and slowing European economies remain the major driver of the euro weakness, with many investors now thinking that June could be a good time to start cutting the rates. Three more rates could follow this year.Across the Atlantic, the US released its latest GDP update and the data
was as good as it could possibly get
. The US economy grew 3.3% in Q4 versus 2% expected by analysts. It grew 2.5% for all of last year quite FAR from a recession. The consumer spending growth slowed to 2.8%, but remained strong on a healthy jobs market and wages growth, business investment and housing were supportive and the cherry on top: the GDP price index, a gauge of inflation fell to 1.5%. Plus, data fromrent.comshowed that the median rent rate declined in December, and thats good news when considering that rents have been one of the major drivers of inflation lately, and they look like they are cooling down. In summary, yesterdays US GDP data was the definition of goldilocks in numbers: good growth, slowing inflation. A dream comes true.As reaction, the
US 2-year yield
fell below 4.30% and the
10-year yield
fell below 4.10%. The strong numbers didnt necessarily hammer the Federal Reserve (Fed) cut expectations given that inflation slowed! Investors are not sure that March would bring the first rate cut from the Fed  as the probability of a March cut is around 50%, but a May cut is almost fully priced in. Today, all eyes are on the Feds favorite gauge of inflation: core PCE  expected to have retreated to 3% in December. A number in line with expectations, or ideally softer than expected could further boost risk appetite.Energy prices could go wrong.Oil
bulls finally got the positive breakout that they were looking for in oil prices. The barrel of American crude cleared the $75pb resistance and extended gains past $77pb on muddy geopolitical picture in the Middle East and on the back of a 9-mio barrel slump in US weekly oil inventories. The American crude tested the 200-DMA, near $77.50pb, to the upside but has so far been unable to take it out.Moving forward: Positive momentum is building, the ample supply story has been broadly priced in and if Mid-East tensions take over the market narrative, there is no reason to keep the oil bulls contained. The next natural target is the 200-DMA. If broken, oil bulls will challenge the $78.60, the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on the September to December selloff, and a breakout above this level will point at a medium-term bullish reversal and could pave the way for a further rise to the $80pb.The
US Dollar Index
ticked higher yesterday, as the euro fell across the board during ECB Lagardes presser. But any further weakness in todays PCE numbers could limit the upside move in the
dollar
index and throw a floor under the EUR/USDs weakness around the 200-DMA.It would sure be absurd if the Fed started cutting the rates with such a strong underlying US economy before the ECB, which, in opposition, deals with a serious economic slowdown across the euro area. But the Fed doesnt (need to) decide based on other central banks actions. As such, a possible earlier Fed cut could slow down the euro depreciation but should not stop it.In equities, the good data gave a positive spin to the
S&P500
and
Nasdaq 100
, but Teslas 10% slump limited gains. Intel (NASDAQ:
INTC
) tumbled 10% in the after-hours trading following a disappointing forecast as it has hard time fighting back the all-strong Nvidia (NASDAQ:

The difference is that this type of trust doesnt have a market mechanism for truing up the difference in its net asset value (NAV)  i.e. the value of the Bitcoin it holds  with the current market price for the shares in its fund.During its early years, when it was the only widely available way to buy and hold Bitcoin in traditional accounts, investors were actually willing to pay big PREMIUMS over the trusts NAV.More recently, the trust has been trading at a substantial DISCOUNT to the underlying value of its holdings  roughly 19% at the time of my original recommendation.Now that the SEC is looking to approve a true spot Bitcoin ETF (TSX:
EBIT
) in 2024, GBTC has rallied strongly. I think ETHE could do the same going forward. Its constructed in the same way as GBTC, and has also been trading at a discount to its NAV.Plus, Ethereum is the other blue-chip cryptocurrency  essentially digital oil to Bitcoins digital gold. Reason: ETH is not primarily used as a medium of exchange or a store of value. It's more like the gas and energy that many crypto-based ecosystems need to operate  things like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi), and the next version of the Internet, commonly called Web3.I believe adoption rates will likely be the biggest driver of cryptocurrency prices going forward  especially when youre talking about Bitcoin and Ethereum. Right now, somewhere between 10% and 15% of the population owns some type of cryptocurrency.Based on how other technologies have been adopted in the past, I would say its highly likely that we will see the curve accelerate toward 85% before this decade is over."
Investing.com,Gold Surges on Increased Safe-Haven Appeal; Euro Drops as US Rate Cuts Unlikely,2024-01-29,0.666667,"The gold (XAU) price was mainly flat on Friday as investors focused on the upcoming US Federal Reserve policy meeting on 31 January, seeking further clarity on the trajectory of interest rates.'We are seeing the gold market consolidating at the moment as the expectations of rate declines aren't quite as soon as the market would like,' mentions David Meger, a director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. 'But underlying theme or the idea that interest rates will come down in 2024 continues to underpin and support the gold market,' he added. The US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index rose in December, marking the third consecutive month when the yearly inflation rise was under 3%. Also, Thursday's Gross Domestic Product report indicated that the US economy's growth in Q4 surpassed expectations. Thus, slowing inflation together with a healthy economy might give the Fed room to begin cutting interest rates soon.In the physical market, gold premiums in China rose this week, buoyed by improved sentiment following additional stimulus measures ahead of the Lunar New Year festivities. Traders are now speculating on six rate reductions of 25 basis points in the US this year, an increase from the five rate cuts projected a week earlier. Thus, expectations of reduced interest rates diminish the opportunity cost of holding bullion, putting additional bullish pressure on gold.Today,
XAU/USD
surged as escalating conflicts in the Middle East made safe-haven XAU/USD more appealing to investors. Market participants are now cautious due to increased geopolitical tensions following a drone strike on US forces in northeastern Jordan. 'Spot gold may retest resistance at 2,028 USD per ounce. A break below could open the way towards the 2,0332,038 USD range,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.The euro (EUR) faced volatility in Friday's trading session but managed to gain 0.6%.Mixed US data released on Friday didn't give markets clarity on the potential path of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy. Although the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index aligned with expectations, the data showed a surprising increase in personal spending. Furthermore, pending home sales increased more than expected, diminishing hopes for an interest rate cut from the Fed in March, supporting the
US dollar
. Currently, the market is pricing in a roughly 49% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut in March.Meanwhile, traders' expectations for the first interest cut in the eurozone have been shifted towards April. Fundamentally, the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) are expected to follow a similar path and begin easing monetary policies at approximately the same time. However, traders will likely favor the US dollar over the euro because the US economy is growing stronger than the E.U.EUR/USD
was falling slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions as mounting geopolitical tensions in the Middle East triggered safe-haven flows into the US dollar. Today, the macroeconomic calendar is uneventful. Furthermore, traders abstain from placing large orders ahead of Wednesday's Fed policy rate decision. As a result, EUR/USD may experience very low volatility today in the absence of any new developments on the geopolitical front.The British pound (GBP) was essentially unchanged on Friday, even though the release of the US economic data caused above-normal volatility.GBP/USD
has been trading sideways for six days as traders reassess their interest rate expectations. The exact timing of when the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England (BOE) will begin cutting interest rates is unclear. However, both central banks will hold policy meetings this week, giving investors more clarity on their interest rate stance. Thus, GBP/USD might finally break out of the tight 1.264001.27700 range on Wednesday or Thursday.Fundamentally, investors expect the BOE to be more hawkish than the Fed because the U.K. has been less successful in fighting inflation. However, investors may be overly optimistic about the Fed's willingness to start easing its monetary policy. The US economy remains robust, and a premature rate reduction might spur a rise in consumer prices. Therefore, GBP/USD bulls should be cautious this week, as any hawkish comments from the Fed might trigger a large sell-off in the pair.GBP/USD was rising slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the formal macroeconomic calendar is light, so volatility will likely remain low if there are no developments in the Middle East. The short-term technical bias remains bearish as the pound remains below an important intraday level of 1.27300."
Investing.com,Quarterly Refunding Announcement May Matter as Much as Fed for Markets This Week,2024-01-29,0.333333,"This week is huge: revisions to 2023 CPI,
US labor market print
, the
Fed
, and, most importantly, the Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA) everyone talks about.So I thought Id share an initial framework for you to understand why everybody seems to care about the details of the US bond supply announced in the QRA.The key is to think of bond supply within the context of the US monetary plumbing.The first thing to understand is the tectonic shift happening at the policymaking level when it comes to the use of fiscal deficits.The chart shows how until 2016 US politicians applied fiscal policy in a counter-cyclical fashion.When the
unemployment rate
(blue) was low like in 2006-2007, they proceeded with a conservative fiscal stance (orange) and reduced deficits.Instead when a big crisis hit like in 2008 and the unemployment rate moved higher, they tried to support the economy with more fiscal deficits.This is a textbook counter-cyclical application of fiscal policy: support the economy by injecting fresh money when it needs it and withdraw support when it's running hot by itself.But in 2016 something changed.Trump became the new US president, and despite unemployment rates dipping below 5% the US budget deficit started expanding anyway.A bit like crocodile jaws opening, for the first time in decades fiscal stimulus was not used to support a weak economy but instead ON TOP of an economy which was already strengthening.As a result, in 2017-2018 the US economy was quite hot - the Fed raised rates, the stock market puked, and in 2019 Powell had to pivot.But as Biden got into office, he recently showed he learnt the same trick too!In the 2023 fiscal year, Biden rapidly expanded fiscal deficits despite a tight job market - hence the crocodile jaws were opened again.The result?A prolonged cycle for the US economy, with inflation which perhaps took a bit longer than expected to start slowing down.As Trump is gaining ground in his race to become the next US president, I wonder whether he's going to continue with this new crocodile jaw paradigm - and my hunch is that he will.US politicians are becoming familiar with the power of fiscal stimulus (but not with the dangers of its excessive use).And by 2028 the majority of voters arent going to be Boomers & Co anymore, but instead Millennials and Gen-Z looking for a change in wealth distribution.Therefore, we can expect a robust use of fiscal stimulus in a semi-permanent way.Now, back to 2024: the Fed is doing QT while Yellen marches ahead with deficits.These are the monetary plumbing mechanics of this exercise - visualized:1-2) The US government proceeds with deficit spending, households and/or corporations get an injection of new money, and (potentially inflationary) bank deposits go up together with reserves in the system;3-4) Simultaneously, bond issuance takes place: Yellen issues bonds, and banks (primary dealers) use reserves to buy bonds at auctions;5-6-7) The Fed runs down its balance sheet through QT, and that works like a net drain of reserves from the financial system.An excessive reduction in bank reserves can become problematic for the smooth functioning of the repo market: banks use reserves to settle repo transactions with each other, and if there is too much collateral (bonds) floating around and too little reserves the repo market can suffer (e.g. 2019).But there is a way around this problem: Yellen issuing T-Bills instead of bonds. This is one of the reasons why everyone is watching the QRA next week:In this case, QT does not drain bank reserves but its instead sterilized.The bottom set of T-Accounts explains why: when the government issues T-Bills and money market funds buy them by draining their existing balances at the RRP facility, bank reserves dont need to take the hit for QT.Its basically sterilized QT.The other incredibly important dynamic is that issuing T-Bills or long bonds has a very different impact on market participants.T-Bills have very little interest rate risk, while long bonds are much heavier to absorb because of their big duration risk.I will be talking about the QRA in details next week, and analyze its direct impact on bond and equity markets.***This article was originally published on The Macro Compass.

Investing.com,Crude Oil,2024-01-29,0.222222,"US crude
jumped past the $79b level this morning on escalating tensions in the Red Sea. The European and American futures are slightly in the negative at the time of writing, and stocks in Hong Kong and China were better bid on Monday as China imposed a ban on short sellers, but the gains remained short-lived after a HK court ordered Evergrandes liquidation.Globally, we see a limited risk appetite at the start of a week packed with economic data, central bank decisions and corporate earnings.European stocks ended last week on a cheerful sentiment. The dovish European Central Bank (ECB) statement nourished appetite. LVMH jumped 9% on strong quarterly sales, and ASML soared after announcing that its orders tripled  as Chinese rushed in to order chips before the export ban became effective.The
EUR/USD
consolidated in the bearish consolidation zone  below the major 38.2% retracement on its latest rebound, and is testing the 200-DMA to the downside. How far the weakness will continue depends on the
US dollar
. And the direction the dollar will take will depend on the Federal Reserve (Fed).US stocks traded mixed on Friday but ended last week on a positive note, with the
S&P 500
near a record, as many good news popped into the headlines throughout the week.The US growth numbers came to enchant investors while inflation numbers looked encouragingly set for further easing: The US economy grew more than 3% last quarter and the Feds favorite inflation gauge, the core PCE index fell below 3%.Resilient growth and lower inflation mean the world to the Fed, a dream come true, the holy grail, the proof that Jay Powell and his team have beaten the economic theory and won over inflation without pushing the US economy into a recession.And since the Fed signaled that there could be 6 rate cuts this year, which is a fair number of rate cuts to be squeezed into a year for an economy that does - pretty - well, all investors care about is: when will the first cut happen?The probability of a March cut is 50-50, a May cut is priced in at about 90%. The Fed will keep rates unchanged this week, and Powell will likely say the same thing than Lagarde last week: that inflation looks on path toward 2% goal, that soft landing is no longer a daydream, and that the Fed will relax rates, but the timing will be data dependent. If thats the case, the natural response of currency traders could be to sell the dollar.Overall, note that because the Fed is insistently expected to cut the rates regardless of strong economic figures, the dollar bears resist to upside pressures. But any dovish euphoria is increasingly likely to hit a road bump with oil prices on the rise again.While everyone expects the dollar to soften moving forward, there are a few scenarios that could lead to a stronger dollar.1.If inflation numbers make a U-turn and interfere with the Feds plan to cut rates, the dollar would see higher demand. Note that among major central banks, the Fed is the one that could delay rate cuts thanks to its strong economic growth.2.The US dollar could gain if other major economies perform even more poorly than they are expected to - because faltering economies would require faster rate cuts outside the US and lead to a stronger US dollar.3.An economic shock in the US, or globally, could trigger a rush to the safe haven US dollar and leave the dollar bears on the backfoot.The Bank of England (BoE) decision, euro area growth, and inflation numbers, Australian inflation update, Canadian GDP, and the US jobs numbers will be closely watched.On the corporate calendar, Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
), Alphabet (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
), Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
), AMD (NASDAQ:
AMD
), and US big oil companies are among the names that are due to announce their latest earnings this week. A major part of the investor focus will be on Microsoft and its AI announcements. Any positive surprise should keep investors on their cloud.But note that, overall, 25% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported results for Q4. Of these companies, 69% have reported actual EPS above estimates, yes but thats below the 5-year average of 77%, according to FactSet."
Investing.com,"Rising Geopolitical Risks, Oil Prices Could Rekindle Inflation Despite Slowdown",2024-01-29,0.333333,"Friday the market woke up to great news.Mission accomplished on inflation.Yahoo Finance reported:Furthermore, the
core PCE
inflation rate fell to 1.5% on a three-month annualized basis, its lowest since late 2020. On a six-month basis, it was 1.9% for the second month in a row.Both of those marks are below the Fed's 2% target. Except, the PCE does not include food and energy.Another headline that hit the news Friday:Oil
traded over $78 a barrel. The price cleared the 200-daily moving average and confirmed an accumulation phase.Should
oil
remain above $78, the next level to watch is $80. Over $80, an emotional trip to $100 is not out of the question.More importantly, that could trigger a bigger move in
gold

silver
.Of course, the Fed cannot dot plot war and geopolitical stress. But shouldnt they?Remember this?If you do not, this is the chart that overlays CPI from the 1970s with CPI from 2014 until the end of 2023.CPI fell to under 2% in 1976-1977, then turned right back around and screamed.Oil had a lot to do with that.Here we are. CPI is not quite at 2% but core PCE is.Should oil continue its run and become more parabolic, then this chart is eerily prescient.Supercycle of commodities?Not all commodities have to run in a super cycle like the one that began in 1977 until the peak in 1980.But if oil and metals take charge, along with certain food commodities, then the FED will be stuck.As for the market that has been counting on rate cuts to keep the equities moving higher?That will present a newer and bigger worry.Stagflation."
Investing.com,Nonfarm Payroll Report and Fed Meeting Loom This Week,2024-01-29,0.666667,"@NeilKSethi over on X is a prolific contributor of economic and market data every day. The man truly works hard at his task.Neil posted the above graphic in the last few days. While I understand the sentiment, speaking with another advisor the other day, this individual noted that not one of his clients was bullish coming into 2024.My own clients rarely offer a market opinion, but I know that I remain cautious which  bizarre as it seems -is a contrarian indicator.So I wind up gauging my own sentiment around the stock and bond markets, and then  like George Costanza  doing the opposite. ( A poor attempt at some self-deprecating weekend humor.)The above chart from the Bespoke Report this weekend notes the breakout in the
Nasdaq 100
, a critical chart for investors given that Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
), Alphabet (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
), Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
), Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) (AMAZON) and META (NASDAQ:
META
) report this week.It was a narrow stock market in 2023, in terms of annual returns, with the so-called Mag 7 leading the way. That may not change in 2024 either.According to this table and explanation from the Bespoke Report, its still an ordinary bull market for the Nasdaq 100, with more room to the upside.If there is a problem with the market-cap weighted indices, well probably know it this week given the number of mega-caps reporting. Heres an earnings preview of Microsoft and Alphabet.Heres the week's economic calendar from www.briefing.com. Briefing does a good job laying out the expected releases and the consensus expectations.While the Fed announcement will get a lot of attention on Wednesday afternoon, there will be no change to fed funds. All the Fed announcements really do is give the mainstream financial media a reason to burn a few hours of airtime, and breathlessly expound with market opinions that will be forgotten almost as soon as they are uttered.There is just a 3.1% chance of the FOMC moving away from 5.25%  5.50% fed funds range this coming Wednesday, January 31 24.Heres the March 24 meeting probability: a little more interesting. Looking at the bottom rows, the odds of a fed funds rate reduction in March 24 have fallen from 78% in Dec 23 to just below 50% as of Friday, Jan 26, 24.That makes sense given the strength in
retail sales
, the stubborn nature of
jobless claims
remaining around 200,000, and the healthy Q4 23
GDP
report from last week of 3.3%.The four jobs-related releases this coming week will matter much to how the probability changes for a March 24 FOMC policy change.David Kelly, JP Morgans world-class economist and Chief Global Strategist, noted in one of his conference calls a few weeks ago that the US economy has few excesses which is a valid and credible point thats always overlooked. It requires a big picture perspective, but JP Morgan and their global reach does offer that. What David means is unlike the late 1990s and 28% annualized return for the
S&P 500
from 1995 to 1999, and then the commodity explosion that lasted from the early 2000s to 2007, which was being driven by Chinas 12% to 15% annual GDP growth from the late 1990s through 2009 or so. However the mother of all excesses was the mortgage and credit availability driving housing prices from 2000 through late 2007, which nearly took down the US economy.The credit markets today seem to be in fairly good shape and thats a big green flag if youre an equity bull. With constant ads for private credit being seen and given its a new asset class and seems to be promoted to retail investors, private credit is a credit subset of the fixed-income asset class that wont be bought for clients until it sees some kind of shakeout.High-yield credit spreads tightened a little last week, although  as an asset class  they appear to still remain a little wider than in late December 23.Commercial real-estate and CMBS seems to be one problem area that Ive read about the last year, but it hasnt shown up in bank conference calls yet, although I havent read all the call notes.Technical positives:How many
Dow Jones Industrial Average
hats did you see on the NYSE floor touting 38,000 for the average, and CNBC anchors wearing their Dow 38,000 hats to celebrate, as was the case in early 2000?The general stock market sentiment just doesnt seem that bullish to me personally, despite the first graph posted at the top.None of this is advice or a recommendation. Take all of this with a healthy grain of skepticism. Past performance is no guarantee or suggestion of future results. Investing can involve the loss of principal, sometime for long periods. Capital markets change quickly for both the good and the bad. Readers should gauge their own comfort with market and portfolio volatility and adjust accordingly.As always thanks to Paul Hickey and the Bespoke staff for all of their excellent technical and fundamental work.As always, thank for reading."
Investing.com,"FX Markets Slow Ahead Of Fed, BoE and NFP Week",2024-01-29,0.666667,"Market activity has been notably subdued recently, not just today, but for the majority of the past week, even amidst significant events like the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting. However, upcoming events such as the Federal Reserve's (FED) announcements, the Bank of England's (BoE) decisions, and the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report this Friday could inject some much-needed volatility into the markets.
These events hold the potential to either bolster the strength of the U.S. dollar or lead to a pullback from its current resistance levels, as suggested by Elliott Wave analysis, which points to a resistance zone around 104-104.30 on the Dollar Index (DXY).
From an EW perspective, we're observing ongoing market correction that might become increasingly complex. However, the resistance levels remains at 104-104.50. Should the DXY drop below the 102.50 mark, confirmed by a daily closing price, it could signal an acceleration of bearish momentum for the dollar. Concurrently, the British Pound (GBP), could surge, and even commodity-linked currencies might experience heightened activity.
Additionally, the Swiss Franc (CHF) could see more gains, potentially benefiting precious metals, particularly silver."

Investing.com,Fed's Liquidity Drain Could Induce a Stock Market Correction,2024-01-29,0.666667,"The Inflation Deflation and Economic Cycle Model measures the liquidity impulse from fiscal and monetary policies. This is how we determine what will occur with the ROC of inflation and economic growth. The current liquidity factors that must be measured are the Treasury General Account (TGA), Reverse Repurchase Agreement (RRP), Fed's balance sheet, Federal Funds Rate (FFR), Bank lending practices, and the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP).On the positive side of the liquidity construct right now are the Reverse Repo Facility (RRF) and the BTFP. The RRF is being aggressively drained to purchase U.S. Treasuries, and the BTFP is being tapped each week to take banks' bad assets off their balance sheets, and in exchange, they receive reserves equal to the par value of those distressed assets.On the neutral side, we have a static FFR and a static TGA level. On the negative side, we have a shrinking Fed balance sheet (Q.T.) and bank lending practices, which are tightening lending standards. Hence, Commercial and Industrial (C&I) loans and M2 money supply is shrinking.All counted, the current liquidity environment is positive. However, come March, this very well should all change. Three months from now, there should be no positive liquidity impulses. In the neutral camp, there will be two: the TGA and the FFR should remain near their current levels.But there should be four negative impulses: the BTFP will expire as planned on March the 11th, bank lending practices will remain negative, the RRP facility will be emptied, and the Fed's Q.T. program is slated to remain in effect--albeit perhaps in the process of being wound down slowly if there is some fracturing of the credit markets. Hence, there should be a significant decline in liquidity come March, which should cause turmoil in the long end of the bond market and lead to a sharp correction in equities.The truth is the spike higher in borrowing costs must soon begin to bite. Record-low, near zero percent borrowing costs that were in place for most of the time between 2008 and 2022 caused a massive dung pile of debt to be incurred.Corporate debt is up 115% since 2010. Rising from $6.4 trillion to $13.8 trillion. The market for CLOs--securitized pools of leveraged loans--has ballooned from $300 billion in 2008 to $1.3 trillion todaythat is an increase of 333%! The national debt is $34 trillion and is 122% of GDP, which is a record high. Annual deficits are $2 trillion. The interest on the debt will be $1 trillion this fiscal year. The annual deficit is 45% of revenue, and the outstanding debt is 750% of revenue.Higher interest rates erode the economic footing like a torrent underneath the foundation of a building. You cannot convince me that this humongous debt overhang will be unaffected by the much higher cost of money.In the meantime, the stock market is priced for perfection and remains on Fantasy Island. This is true even though a record 40% of companies in the Russell 2000 are unprofitable. For Q4 2023, the blended (year-over-year) earnings decline for the
S&P 500
is -1.7%.However, Wall Street is pricing in 11% EPS growth for all this year. But in truth, the S&P 500 is on track for 4 out of the last 5 quarters having falling earnings growth. The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.5. This P/E ratio is above the 5-year average (18.9) and above the 10-year average (17.6). Meaning even if you get that ridiculously optimistic 11% EPS growth, the market is still overvalued--and not by a little bit. The stock market is 40% overvalued using the historical method of TMC/GDP.After all, how healthy can an economy be when the goods-producing sector is on life support? The manufacturing sector of the economy has been contracting for the past 14 months in a row. The NY area manufacturing sector is in a depression. The level of that index is now at its lowest since the economy shut down in May 2020.The real estate market is also a minefield. According to the National Association of Realtors, existing U.S. home sales totaled 4.09 million last year, an 18.7% decline from 2022. That was the weakest year for home sales since 1995 and the biggest annual decline since 2007, which was at the start of the Great Recession and Real estate crisis.The median home price-to-income ratio is at a record high of 5.56. This ratio was 5.0 in 2007. Buying a home is now over 50% more expensive than just being a renter. The previous peak of this metric was 33%, leading up to the real estate crash and GFC of 2008.According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, annual homeownership payments, which include taxes and insurance, ate up 46.4% of the median U.S. household income, which is at a record high. The pre-COVID figure was 29%. According to the National Association of Realtors, only 23% of houses in the U.S. are affordable to the first-time homebuyer. That number was 50% a year ago.The commercial real estate market is in shambles, but the ramifications have yet to be felt. $1.5 trillion in commercial real estate loans come due in the next two years. Interest rates have soared, and occupancy rates have plunged to an all-time low. The price of these office spaces and the loans attached to them have dropped by 40%. This is a huge problem for banks, which have 30% of their assets in commercial Mortgage-backed Securities (CMBS).Given all these facts, it isn't any wonder why the leading indicators of the U.S. economy fell in December for the 21st month in a row. That is where the economic puck is going, Gretsky. However, in this negative context, the labor market remains strong, at least according to the official numbers from the Department of Labor.Combine that with the A.I. hype and hopes of rate cuts, and you get a new high in the S&P 500 in nominal terms. Of course, in inflation-adjusted terms, we are not even close to a new high. And the broader market, as represented by the
Russell 2000
, is still down more than 20% from its high seen in late 2021, and that is in nominal terms.This index is also down 3% YTD. So, at least we are seeing some reality there. The equal weight S&P 500 is down over 1% so far this year and is down 5% from its high of 2021. The very narrow rally, which was seen in just a handful of mega-cap tech stocks last year, continues to march on.PPS remains net long the market due to quiescent credit markets and financial conditions. But that allocation could and should change significantly come March when the liquidity impulse turns negative. There should be a mad dash for the narrow emergency exit door at that time, especially in those few mega-cap tech names where investors believe they have achieved recession-proof shelter. We remain alert and fully prepared for it all."

Investing.com,"Debt-Relief Rally Short-Lived? Focus Shifts to Fed, Earnings Amid Crucial Week",2024-01-30,0.666667,"Stocks got a bump late in the day after the US Treasury announced it would borrow $55 billion less than projected last quarter.It now expects to borrow just $760 billion in privately held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $750 billion.

It was unusual that the VIX didnt give back all of its gains throughout the day.It is never strange to wake up on a Monday to see the VIX green.Typically, though, that results in volatility selling all day, helping to push stock prices higher. What isnt typical is to see the VIX green all on a Monday, for volatility selling not to show and the

Investing.com,Gold Price Consolidates Ahead of Fed's Decision; EUR/USD Continues to Fall,2024-01-30,0.333333,"The gold (XAU) price rose by 0.66% on Monday as tensions in the Middle East increased the demand for safe-haven assets.It appears that geopolitical uncertainty is the only factor pushing
XAU/USD
higher. Conversely, changing interest rate expectations exert downward pressure on XAU/USD. Investors currently price in less than a 47% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) in March. About a week ago, the probability was close to 60%. If interest rates remain higher for longer, gold should lose its appeal since the asset doesn't yield any passive income. Thus, the upcoming Fed's interest rate decision on 31 January is crucialit might provide clues on future changes in US monetary policy.XAU/USD was rising during the Asian and early European trading session. Today, traders will probably refrain from opening large positions in the metals market as the Fed's decision looms. Two important US macroeconomic reports will come out today at 3:00 p.m. UTC: the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence report and JOLTS Job Opening data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Both reports will likely trigger above-normal volatility in the market. Any data revealing a strong jobs market and optimistic consumer sentiment tends to have a bearish impact on gold as it raises the probability of interest rates staying high for longer. Worse-than-expected numbers will have a bullish impact on gold, potentially pushing the price towards 2,043.The euro (EUR) lost 0.18% on Monday as the
US Dollar Index
continued to rise.On Monday, eurozone government bond yields dropped as markets priced in the first 25 basis point (bps) rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) in April. ECB policymakers said that the central bank's next move would be cutting the base rate but didn't indicate the exact timing. ECB hawk Peter Kazimir said the rate cut would more likely come in June rather than April. Investors expect roughly 140 bps worth of rate cuts in 2024 and anticipate similar reductions by the Federal Reserve (Fed) over the same period. Therefore, monetary policy expectations are more or less balanced, and there is no clear divergence that might boost one currency or another. If eurozone reports show soft economic growth and inflation figures, this could increase expectations for the ECB's monetary policy easing.EUR/USD
was falling in the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, investors will focus on the preliminary eurozone's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth report for Q4 at 10:00 a.m. UTC. However, the most critical GDP data from Germany will be released at 9:00 a.m. UTC. The market expects the figures to show a mild decline in economic activity. If the figures are weaker than expected, the bearish trend in EUR/USD might accelerate. In addition, EUR/USD traders will likely see additional volatility due to the release of important macrostatistics from the US: the Consumer Confidence and JOLTS Job Opening reports, both at 3:00 p.m. UTC. Weaker-than-expected figures might support EUR/USD. However, the pair might drop below 1.08000 if US data exceeds the forecast.On Monday, the Australian dollar (AUD) rose by 0.56% as US Treasury yields dropped.Australian retail sales fell by 2.7% in December, reversing a November rise caused by Black Friday sales, with annual spending growth slowing to pandemic-era lows. Sluggishness in retail sales shows the pressure on household budgets, prompting the market to believe the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) won't increase the base rate in next week's policy meeting. Still, the Australian dollar and bond futures remained stable. As the interest rate in Australia is at a 12-year high and consumers are cutting back on non-essential purchases, pressure on household budgets may ease later this year when taxes will be decreased. Sean Langcake, the lead macroeconomic forecaster at Oxford Economics Australia, said retail volumes probably remained stagnant throughout Q4 last year, hardly impacting economic growth. He mentioned that 'tighter policy settings are working to restrain demand, and growth in retail sales over the first half of the year is likely to be quite patchy.'AUD/USD
rose during the Asian trading window but started declining in the European session's early hours. Focus is now on the Australian Inflation Rate report that will be released on 31 January at 12:30 a.m. UTC. Economists predict headline consumer inflation to decline towards a 2-year low of 4.3%, suggesting that additional rate hikes may not be necessary. Today's important event is the release of the US JOLTs Job Openings report at 3:00 p.m. UTC. If the figures are higher than expected, AUD/USD may fall below 0.66000. However, if the data is weaker than anticipated, the Australian dollar might continue its local bullish trend."

Let's discover together the most attractive investment opportunities and how to make the most of them.We will also analyze the general macroeconomic situation and I will provide information on my open positions to share my views and investment strategies.Despite some disappointments in quarterly results, there is a positive mood for stock markets. Wall Street continued to reach new highs, buoyed by the stability of the U.S. economy and the prospect of an upcoming interest rate cut.Europe is enjoying the benefits of decelerating inflation and good performance by large companies, while Asia is catching up after the announcement of new support measures in China.The ECB held a meeting but was completely eclipsed by data on U.S. economic activity. Although the central bank kept rates and its rhetoric unchanged, U.S. GDP rose 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter, exceeding forecasts of 2 percent.This suggests that the economy may have a soft landing, as also indicated by the U.S. manufacturing and services PMIs that have returned to the expansion zone.In addition, the risk of recession is easing further. The Future
S&P 500
Mar 2024 reached new all-time highs and the yield on the
10-year
U.S. bond reached a low from 4.23/25 percent.Highlighted this week are Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:
NFLX
) and Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) Inc.Netflix overcame market doubts about its growth. The streaming giant reported a 12.5 percent increase in revenues for the quarter thanks to growth in the number of subscribers to 260 million (+12.8 percent). The company reported operating income of $1.49 billion, nearly tripling that of the previous year, and net income exploded from $55 million to $938 million.However, Netflix's stock price is currently very high, so I do not recommend buying at these levels. Tesla is facing several obstacles at the moment. The group reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter results, with lower-than-expected sales growth and an annual decline in non-GAAP earnings.The recall of 200,000 vehicles in the United States due to a software problem with rearview mirrors is just the latest blow to the company after a major recall just two months ago.In addition, management's comments about profitability in 2024 and forecasts of a further decline in profitability have made the situation worse. In the near future, we may see a price decrease of up to 20 percent.Futures in the energy and fossil fuel sector are performing well. Future Crude Oil WTI - Mar 2024 prices have been supported by encouraging economic data and ongoing Red Sea issues.
Brent
passed the $80 per barrel mark, while the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter.This was also confirmed by January PMIs, which exceeded economists' expectations.In addition, U.S. weekly inventories fell significantly from consensus (-9.2 million instead of -1.2 million), providing further support for rising prices. Due to recent tensions in the Red Sea, the price of
crude oil
, could exceed $80.The
Natural Gas Future
- U.S. Mar 2024 are trading around $2.09/MMBtu with a weekly increase of 4.4 percent, indicating a slight recovery from the previous 24 percent slump.According to the most recent government data, U.S. utilities withdrew 326 billion cubic feet of
natural gas
from storage facilities last week, exceeding market expectations of 322 bcf.This was the highest weekly withdrawal since February 2021 due to strong gas demand caused by extreme cold weather.Although storage levels are decreasing, they still remain above the seasonal average of 5.2 percent. Heating demand is expected to be low in the coming weeks due to higher-than-average temperatures until at least Feb. 7.This situation makes optimistic forecasts for natural gas in the near future difficult. We may also see new lows in prices during this quarter, possibly falling as low as $1.60.The value of Future Gold - Apr 2024 is stable at 2020 USD, pending the Fed's rate cut. Personally, I do not expect the Fed to cut its interest rate in the short term, so I maintain a bearish position on gold with a target at 1980 USD in the short term.There is a technical rebound going on in the cryptocurrency market.Last week was negative, the
CME Bitcoin
Future - Feb 2024 declined, dropping to around $41,000 and down more than 1 percent since Monday. The ether, on the other hand, suffered a more significant drop, falling more than 8 percent over the same period and now hovers around $2,250.Among the reasons for the decrease in the ether's valuation is the postponement of the SEC's decision on Grayscale and BlackRock (NYSE:
BLK
)'s
Ethereum
Spot ETFs. On the other hand, the approval of the eleven
Bitcoin
Spot ETFs had an effect opposite to investors' expectations.Since the ETFs were approved on January 11, the value of Bitcoin has fallen by 15 percent, leading to an overall loss of nearly $200 billion in the cryptocurrency market. This was all predicted in my recent articles on cryptocurrency price movements.Currently, the Bitcoin market is highly promising and I may consider buying to benefit from the possible increase in value in the second quarter.Here are my current positions:I have confirmed my purchase on the
Hang Seng

Investing.com,"S&P 500 Renews Record Ahead of Big Tech Earnings, Fed Decision",2024-01-30,0.666667,"It was yet another day, and another record high for the US major stock indices. The
S&P 500
traded to 4930 for the first time, driven higher by falling US yields after the US Treasury surprisingly cut its quarterly borrowing estimate, on hope that five of 7 Magnificent stocks will surprise positively when they reveal their results this week, and on hope that we might hear something relatively dovish from the Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting this week.The dovish Fed expectations prevent the
US Dollar Index
from making a decisive move above its 200-DMA. Investors expect the Fed to cut the rates from May and the
dollar
to lose value this year. Yet the Feds path to rate cuts may not be as swift as many believe if inflation numbers start looking bad again. Rents  which are the main responsibility of the remaining inflation pressures are expected to ease and be the major driver of inflation to the Feds 2% target, yet gasoline prices which fell more than 50% since the summer 2022 peak to the end of last year, and which helped bringing inflation down from a 9% peak, start showing signs of rebounding since the start of the year. For now, the rise is not alarming, but the base effect will likely play against the falling inflation trend in the next few months. It will be interesting to see if the rise in rents fall sufficiently and soon enough to temper the rise that we see today in energy prices. The latter may or may not prevent the Fed from cutting in the H1, but it will help investors to scale back their 150bp cut expectations for this year. And that could help alleviate the US dollar.Elsewhere, the
EUR/USD
has been benefiting from limited courage to sell the US dollar, but the pair is extending losses below its 200-DMA on the expectation that the European Central Bank (ECB) cant keep its interest rates at the current levels with the sputtering economies. This morning, the Eurozone countries will start revealing their inflation and growth updates. The euro areas aggregate GDP for Q4 is due today, and inflation for January is due on Thursday. The lower the growth, and the slower the inflation, the sooner the ECB will cut rates. But if inflation surprises to the upside, we could see a part of the ECB dovishness vanish, even with gloomy growth numbers. We shall see support in the EUR/USD into the 1.0793/1.0775  area that includes the 50% Fibonacci retracement on the October to December rebound and the 100-DMA.In energy,
crude oil
remains upbeat after last weeks positive price breakout above $75pb and the rising tensions in the Red Sea region as everyone is now expecting the US response to the latest attacks. US crude saw resistance into the $80pb level yesterday and we could see consolidation between $78/80pb before a potential breakout above the $80pb psychological level. Oil stocks are better bid with the rising oil. Exxon (NYSE:
XOM
) rebounded more than 7% since last week and could well break above the September-to-now descending channel if Fridays results satisfy investors.And oh, green transition goals are being thrown to the garbage. Yesterday, a hedge fund called Bluebell asked BP (NYSE:
BP
) to cut spending on clean energy and boost its oil and gas investments instead. They said that BP is preparing to operate in a world that BP should know will not exist. Anyway, BP and other oil companies will likely see the benefits of rising oil prices. BP looks like an interesting long with a 500p target."
Investing.com,Fed 'Fuel' Will Propel Gold and Silver Higher,2024-01-30,0.555556,"The stock market bubbled back up in 2023 because the Fed, despite a gradual reduction in its balance sheet, has been injecting liquidity in various forms into the banking system. This occurred explicitly in March 2023 when it printed $400 billion to resuscitate the regional banks. The Bank Term Funding Program, though small relative to the Feds balance sheet, is another form of banking system liquidity. Theres some other nooks and crannies through which the Fed is injecting liquidity into the banks but I believe the Fed will have to crank up the printing press again aggressively to fight both a banking system crisis and a debt crisis. This will be the fuel that propels the precious metals sector.With respect to the Feds implicit pivot on its interest rate policy at the November FOMC meeting, systemic financial conditions eased in November and December combined by the greatest amount over a two-month period in the history of metric:This frenetic easing of financial conditions orchestrated by the Fed is the reason the precious metals sector outperformed the stock market in the last two months of 2023. Between October 6th and year-end,
gold
ran from $1823 to $2071, or 13.6%. Similarly,
silver
ran from $20.85 to $23.76, or 14%. Over the same timeframe, the
S&P 500
rose 10% and the
Nasdaq
climbed 11.8%. The mining stocks as represented by
GDX
jumped 15.3% over that time period.I find it amazing that gold and silver outperformed the stock market while GDX outperformed the S&P 500 by 50% from early October through year-end, yet there was zero commentary to that effect from the mainstream financial media. It is this anonymity factor with respect to the precious metals sector that makes it a textbook value investment play. This performance by gold, silver, and mining stocks should be well set-up by financial and economic tailwinds which will continue, if not intensify, in 2024.Specifically, an examination of several individual bank quarterly financial statements reveals that the delinquency, default and charge-off rates are increasing at an increasing rate, particularly in commercial real estate and household debt. For banks that emphasize consumer credit, like Synchrony, Discover and Capital One, the delinquency and default rates are much higher than the average across all banks. The rate of delinquency in subprime auto loans is higher than it was at its peak during the great financial crisis era.This financial stress in the banking system is hidden in plain sight. It simply requires examining bank financial filings. But mainstream media reporters would rather just regurgitate the banks are in good shape propaganda fed to them by the Fed and Biden Administration. For now, the financial stress at these banks has been subtly papered over by the Fed as described above. But at some point it will require considerably more liquidity creation than has been made available up to this point.Hence, the probability is high that 2024 will witness the official rebirth of QE, though Im guessing the Fed will label the program with something other than QE (something like current not QE-QE Bank Term Funding Program). The only question in my mind is the scale and duration of the precious metals sector bull move that I believe will unfold over the coming months and quarters in response to the next stage of full-blown money printing.In that regard, the Monetary Base (bank reserves plus currency/ coin in circulation) has been rising since February 2023. This suggests that the Fed started injecting reserves into the banking before the regional bank crisis surfaced which indicates that the Fed knew what was coming. The Monetary Base is up 9.5% since February 2023. Keep in mind that the Fed removed the reserve requirement for banks in 2020, which means that the increase in bank reserves per the Monetary Base creates a multiplier effect that is likely the reason behind the reflation of the stock bubble and dramatic drop Treasury yields at the long end of the yield curve.The point here is that, while it seems obvious that the Fed will need to crank up the printing press this year to keep the banking system solvent and to help fund the coming flood of new Treasury bond issuance, by some measures the Fed has already begun injecting liquidity into the banking system. The rising Monetary Base is just one indicator but it partially explains the unprecedented spike in financial conditions detailed above. Eventually, these monetary system developments will translate into much higher prices for gold and silver."

Can it really happen, and how should citizens of the world prepare to handle it?JP Morgans Jamie Dimon thinks it can happen. He gives America roughly the same decade of time that Ive suggested the nation hasBefore global stock and bond markets tumble into the abyss in rebellious reaction to the US governments debt addiction reaching overdose status.The long-term US rates chart. The inverse H&S action fits with Jamies scenario; bond market investors likely remain timid until around 2029.From there? Well, from there out of control debt worship by the US government creates skyrocketing inflation, and bond market terror, and when the 2030s begin
gold probably stages its next parabolic move higher, and does so as US stock and bond markets incinerate.Why the year 2029? Well, one reason involves market cycles. Big market anniversaries and cycles need to be respected. October 2029 is the 100th anniversary of the epic 1929 US stock market crash!Also, 
Super Trumpy Man
 (Donald Trump) is likely to be elected again this year. Hell do many good things,
but getting rid of vile US fiat and replacing it with gold is unlikely to be one of them.Hell drain the fiat swamp of some human swamp creatures, but unless he drains the fiat itself and replaces it with
gold
,
not much can change with respect to the US governments long-term debt obsession.As Trumps second term ends, a government debt fiend like Roosevelt probably gets elected in 2028
and eagerly announces dramatic debt expansion.That would create a huge wave of 
breaking point
fresh inflation. US stock/bond market investors would finally balk at the insanity
and sell those markets aggressively with no plans to rebuy them.Unlike in the 1930s, the average American now owns no gold, so theres none to confiscate. The bottom line: There wont be any confiscation this time, but there will be a lot of mayhem. America is a horrifying debtor nation now its basically the opposite entity of what it was in the 1920s.The price of gold will go ballistic as the US government enters a de facto collapse state. That will create surreal amounts of new wealth for the gold-oriented citizens of China, India and for savvy gold bugs in the West!The road to the 
Venezuelification of America
is a very real road, and to avoid becoming roadkill, gold bugs need only follow some very basic rules of the road.The fantastic weekly gold chart. Theres an inverse H&S bottom in play for the Stochastics oscillator (14,5,5 series), and H&S action is also apparent on the BPGDM gold-stock sentiment index.The BPGDM sits right above the 30 area, which is a major buy zone for the miners. I outlined the $2010 gold price as a key buying area for gamblers, and the trade looks great so far. For investors, $1973 (basis the cash price of gold) is the next big buy zone for the miners. Also, tomorrows FOMC meet and Fridays jobs report could be the catalysts that launch golds next big rally, which may or may not begin from $1973.To succeed in the gold market, gold stock and
silver
bullion investors simply need to wait for $100+/oz gold price sales that put the price near previous key highs or lows
and buy there and only there.
Its really that simple.A look at the daily gold chart. Stochastics is flashing a buy signal in the oversold zone
and a move over the red dotted trendline would usher in significant hedge fund short covering and long position buying on the COMEX.The daily silver chart. Interestingly, silver has already taken out its downtrend line as of yesterday and theres some loose bull wedge action in play.The COT report for silver is in sync with the technical breakout. The hedge funds are price chasers and the deep-pocket commercials buy value. Its likely that the funds are already booking losses on their short positions and any follow-through to yesterdays breakout should see them load up on longs and ignite the next big rally!The COT report is a lagging indicator, but its a very good one.A look at the miners. While Silver staged a nice breakout yesterday, the day also featured the arrival of 
game changer
 volume for this important CDNX junior stocks index. Some gold bugs have no interest in the junior sector, but key action the CDNX often is often followed by similar action in the intermediates and seniors so its important for all gold bugs to keep an eye on major junior index events. The volume here is significant!The GDX (NYSE:
GDX
) daily chart. GDX has a slight but bullish RSI non-confirmation with the price and theres a budding Stochastics buy signal coming into play.The FOMC announcement and jobs report could bring intense volatility. A double-bottom scenario at $27.25 for GDX (with gold approaching $1973) is possible, but unlikely. Regardless, after this weeks interest rate decision and employment statistics smoke clears, and a major upside rally is the most likely order of business for gold, silver, and most miners too!"

The other in 2019, came after precious metals corrected for three years and right as the Federal Reserve cut rates for the first time in a while.As long as the Fed cuts rates over the coming months, we could see a repeat of 2019."
Investing.com,Tech Earnings,2024-01-31,0.666667,"We had good news, bad news, and news that are fundamentally good for the economy and bad for the global rate cut expectations.Good news. The European economies performed better than expected last quarter. Spanish and Italian growth tempered the German contraction, fueled the idea that the Eurozone is also having a lighter version of soft landing. The IMF raised its global growth forecast from 2.9% to 3.1% this year saying that the strong US growth and stimulus measures in China should show in better growth numbers. Yes, but the latest PMI numbers showed that manufacturing in China shrank for the 4th month and the CSI 300 index already gave back all gains accumulated on last weeks series of stimulus news; the China story remains in limbo.Bad news. Good growth in Spain came along with an unexpected jump in inflation. More euro area countries will be releasing their inflation figures today. And given that growth numbers were better-than-expected, a set of stronger-than-expected inflation data for the Eurozone should throw a floor under the euros weakness, by weakening the European Central Bank (ECB) doves hands. The euro which partially reversed yesterdays losses, is still under decent selling pressure this morning with a crowded resistance into the 200-DMA which stands near the 1.0840 level. The current market pricing suggests a 75% chance for an April ECB cut. But April feels early with the upside risks building for inflation. Therefore, an uptick in inflation figures could help the
EUR/USD
go back above its 200-DMA.The Federal Reserve (Fed) will announce its latest decision today and Jay Powell will tell investors about his version of where things are going. Data-wise, we had a mixed bag of news from the US as well, both in terms of economic data and corporate results.The bad-good news was that the US job openings increased in December - not cool when you helplessly want the US jobs market to loosen so that the Fed could cut rates.But the bad, good news is that we still have many layoff news on the headlines. PayPal (NASDAQ:
PYPL
) cuts 2500 jobs, UPS plans 12000 job cuts, Meta (NASDAQ:
META
), Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
), Google (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) and even Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
) cut jobs. So far in January, 23500 jobs were terminated.The ADP report is expected to print a fairly soft 145K new private job openings in January.Microsoft released its latest quarterly results after the bell yesterday. Both earnings and revenue were better than expected, the cloud unit Azure made 30% more last quarter compared to the final quarter of last year where OpenAI was not yet part of our lives. Their results overshadowed Googles cloud business  which grew
only
24% more than the same time a year earlier.BUT. But Microsoft stocks fell up to 2% in the after-hours trading because the company gave a light quarterly outlook. Anything less than mind-blowing is weak at the current valuations. Therefore, profit-taking in Microsoft and elsewhere is perhaps on todays menu. Google fell almost 6% and AMD (NASDAQ:
AMD
) fell more than 6% in the after-hours trading after their results failed to match expectations.Is this the beginning of profit-taking and correction? Could be. The
S&P 500
has been running from record to record this January, mostly due to the extension of the Big Tech rally. MAMAA stocks are up by more than 10% since the beginning of January. Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
)  which became the icon of the AI rally and which hit a fresh record yesterday, is up by almost 35% since the beginning of this month. Investors have been piling in despite overbought market conditions and overstretched valuations. Yet the earnings misstep could well be a trigger for long-awaited profit-taking across the US technology stocks. If thats the case, even a soft Fed could hardly make investors feel better.Bear in mind that despite the rise in interest rates last year, technology stocks, which are usually responsive to Federal Reserve rates, largely disregarded these increases. The dominance of AI in the market overshadowed every economic development. It's worth noting that profit-taking might occur even in the face of potential improvements in financial conditions."

So it's a nice drop meaning that RBA can be more dovish, but still as long as data is above 4% it remains far from RBA inflation target (midpoint target is 2.5).

That caveat aside, our opening median nowcast indicates a 1.5% rise in Q1

(seasonally adjusted annual rate).Thats a hefty downshift from Q4s robust 3.3% rise
,
a gain that surprised most analysts, including CapitalSpectator.coms
final estimate
ahead of the governments report last week.The haircut for the Q1 estimate implies that last years strong run of economic activity faces stronger headwinds this year. Nonetheless, a 1.5% rise in Q1 GDP is still strong enough to keep
recession risk relatively low
.Meanwhile, survey data for January paints an upbeat profile, based on this months US PMI
Composite
Output Index, a proxy for GDP.This benchmark rose to 52.3 in the opening month of the year, marking a seven-month high. A reading above the neutral 50 mark equates with growth, moderately so in this case.The firmer PMI print reflects an encouraging start to the year, says Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, which publishes the data.Another bright spot that could provide crucial support to economic activity in the months ahead is the recovering mood in the consumer sector.Yesterdays ongoing recovery in the Consumer Confidence Index for January lifted this measure to a two-year high."

policy decision
at its first meeting of the year on Wednesday. No action by the central bank is seen as the most likely outcome, as investors believe the Fed is all done tightening.However, commentary from
Fed Chair Jerome Powell
could help sway market sentiment as monetary policy adjustments hang in the balance.As such, there will be a lot on the line when the U.S. central bank announces its latest rate decision at 2:00PM ET on Wednesday.The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its FOMC policy meeting, as officials continue to assess signs of a resilient economy and slowing inflation. That would leave the benchmark Fed funds target range between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it has been since July.Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold what will be a closely watched press conference half an hour after the conclusion of the FOMC meeting at 2:30PM ET, as investors look for fresh clues on when the Fed might start cutting rates.After raising borrowing costs by 525 basis points since March 2022, many market participants are growing more confident that the Feds policy tightening campaign is all but over and that rate cuts are now on the horizon.With that being said, investor bets are still mixed on when the first Fed rate cut might happen.For a while, financial markets were betting that the U.S. central bank will start lowering rates in March. But more recently, those bets have been pushed back to May following a recent batch of upbeat economic data.As of Wednesday morning, financial markets see about a 55% chance of the Fed leaving rates at current levels in March, compared to a 45% probability of 0.25% rate cut.Looking out to May, investors believe there is a roughly 85% chance rates are lower by the end of that meeting, as per the Investing.com

, down from around 100% just a few weeks ago.Source: Investing.comAt the previous Fed meeting in late December 2023, Powell acknowledged that more rate hikes are unlikely and the time for rate cuts is drawing closer.In addition, new dot-plot forecasts showed three quarter-point rate cuts in 2024, assuming that economic growth slows considerably during the year and inflation takes another leg lower.But since the last FOMC meeting, U.S. economic data and comments by several Fed officials have not supported that view.Indeed,
consumer price inflation
(CPI) rose 3.4% from a year ago in December, accelerating from 3.1% in November. Excluding the more volatile food and energy items, core prices rose 3.9%, faster than the 3.8% rate most economists projected.Furthermore, the economy continues to hold up much better than expected in the face of higher rates, with
GDP
rising 3.3% in the fourth quarter, trouncing estimates for growth of 2.0%.Despite widespread forecasts of a potential U.S. recession, the economy has proven considerably more resilient than anticipated amid a strong labor market and robust consumer spending.While the Fed is all but certain to leave rates unchanged, I believe there is a substantial risk that Powell could strike a more hawkish tone than expected in his post-meeting news conference given that the economy continues to grow at a robust pace.In addition, while inflation is cooling, it is not slowing fast enough to allow the Fed to declare mission accomplished and pivot to a dovish policy stance.As such, Powell is likely to push back against market expectations for an imminent rate cut and reiterate that policymakers will remain dependent on incoming economic data in determining their next move.Additionally, watch Powell to stress that he only sees cuts happening when the Fed is confident inflation is sustainably moving back to its 2% goal.I am of the opinion that the Fed will be on hold for at least the first half of 2024 and a rate cut would likely only come in September as the economy holds up better than expected, the labor market remains strong, and inflation takes longer to return to the Fed's 2% target than many had hoped.That being the case, the U.S. central bank could keep policy rates higher for longer than markets currently anticipate.Any indications or shifts in the Fed's tone during the meeting could trigger significant market movements and investor sentiments. Taking that into consideration, market participants are advised to remain vigilant, exercise caution, and diversify portfolios to hedge against potential market fluctuations.Be sure to check out

Investing.com,"Gold Nears 2-Week High, EUR/USD Remains Highly Volatile; Fed Meeting in Focus",2024-01-31,0.666667,"The gold (XAU) price rose by 0.21% on Tuesday as a weaker
US dollar
made the metal more appealing for holders of other currencies.Still,
XAU/USD
failed to consolidate above the critical 2,045 level, as yesterday's drop in the
US Dollar Index
was inconclusive. Besides, the US macroeconomic reports were mostly stronger than expected, lowering the probability of an interest rate cut in March. While the Conference Board report revealed a minor drop in consumer confidence in January, the Bureau of Labour Statistics indicated an unexpected rise in job openings in December, showing that the labour market remains strong. Thus, the Federal Reserve (Fed) might be more willing to continue its tight monetary policy.XAU/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Even though today's main event is the Fed's interest rate decision at 7 p.m. UTC, the ADP Nonfarm Employment report release at 1:15 p.m. may also trigger some volatility. The market expects the Fed to leave its base rate unchanged at 5.255.50%. However, the regulator may add important details in its monetary policy statement that could affect investors' interest rate expectations in 2024. A hawkish statement that downplays rate cuts and focuses on inflation-fighting will trigger a sell-off in XAU/USD. Otherwise, a dovish message may push the gold price towards 2,050.The
euro
(EUR) strengthened on Tuesday following the release of better-than-expected Eurozone Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures.Although the release of the German GDP Growth Rate report revealed a contraction in the economy in Q4 2023 alongside stagnant economic growth in France, the eurozone managed to avoid a technical recession successfully. Still, the economic situation in Europe remains unstable and forces the European Central Bank (ECB) to consider reducing interest rates sooner to prevent a severe economic slump. Thus, the market expects a 25 basis point rate reduction by April. Meanwhile, US data indicated an unexpected rise in job openings in December and strong consumer confidence, decreasing chances that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will start easing monetary policy in Q1. As a result, the divergence between US and eurozone monetary policies favours the US dollar, at least in the short term.EUR/USD fell sharply in the early European session as investors anticipated key reports. Today, traders should prepare for increased volatility as the macroeconomic calendar is full of important events. In Europe, the main focus will be on data from Germany: Retail Sales, Unemployment Rate, and Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports released at 7:00 a.m., 8:55 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. UTC. Reports will determine the overall sentiment in Europe. Moreover, the US ADP Employment Change at 1:15 p.m. UTC and the Fed's Interest Rate Decision at 7:00 p.m. UTC will move the market. If the Fed sounds hawkish and suggests it's too soon to cut interest rates, EUR/USD will continue to move downpossibly towards last year's December low of 1.07300. However, if the Fed sound dovish and investors' confidence in the rate cut in March increases, EUR/USD may rebound towards 1.09000.The
Japanese yen
(JPY) lowered on Tuesday, but the drop wasn't deep as the US dollar weakened slightly despite better-than-expected labour market statistics.The sentiment in USD/JPY remains mixed. On the one hand, financial markets think the chances of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in March are well below 50%, which is exerting upward pressure on the US dollar. On the other hand, investors continue to believe that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will end its ultra-loose monetary policy in 2024 and are pricing in the first 25 basis points rate hike in July. Still, USD/JPY continues to move sideways without any clear trend as traders hope to see more clues on the future path of interest rates, particularly from the Fed.USD/JPY increased slightly in the Asian and early European trading sessions. All eyes will be on the Fed's rate decision today at 7:00 p.m. UTC. The market expects the US central bank to leave the interest rate unchanged, but investors will focus on any clues from the post-meeting statement and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech on the likelihood of a rate cut in March. USD/JPY will almost certainly break out of its tight 146.700148.800 trading range after the Fed decision and the press conference. Hawkish details or comments, signalling the rate cut may be postponed, will lead to an upward break, and USD/JPY may reach 150.000. If the conference has a dovish tone, suggesting that the rate cut is needed, the pair will drop and may potentially test the 145.000 level."

Investing.com,Fed Turns on the Hawkish Blinkers,2024-02-01,0.333333,"By Padhraic GarveyWe are a bit surprised the market has not moved more on the
Feds firm preference
for a holding pattern on rates. Bottom line we see pressure for yields to edge higher on a multi-week view. Not happening so far, but thats the view. From the BoE, our economist's base case is a 9-0 vote to hold after the 6-3 vote in December. Another holding pattern ongoingWe are a bit surprised the market has not moved more on the Feds firm preference for a holding pattern on rates. As far as the market discount is concerned, theres still near a 50% probability attached to a cut in March. This must change. We still think this should be in the 35% area, in terms of the probability for a cut for March. And as it moves there, it can pressure the
10-year yield
back above 4%, and it should stay above for a bit. The refunding story this morning has a bottom-line narrative of heavy supply. There is too much talk there on silver linings. The bottom line its heavy. And now we see the Fed is not cutting. At least not yet. As that gets factored in it's tough to see market rates ratcheting lower here. The NY Community (NYSE:
NYCB
) Bancorp (NASDAQ:
CTBI
) story also looks isolated, so far, and so not systemic. Bottom line we see pressure for yields to edge higher on a multi-week view. Not happening so far, but thats the view.This was the FOMC meeting from which some big decisions on quantitative tightening (QT) tapering was thought to be indicated. Weve been of the consistent opinion that the runway the Fed is on in terms of QT is perfectly fine. The Fed can continue to do the $95bn per month for at least the coming 5 months, and after that, it could either continue at this pace for another 6 months and then stop, or it could taper if it chooses to. Either way they have time, and that appears to be the way they have approached it at this meeting. It seems the market got too attached to commentary on telegraphing QT intentions from the previous FOMC minutes. This was no more than an early prudent discussion and not a significant telegraphing event. This Fed is on a holding pattern here too, maintaining the QT at its current pace. We view that as perfectly fine at this juncture.On the refunding numbers, even though the issuance projections for the second quarter are steady versus the first quarter, they are still projections at an exceptionally elevated level as set for todays release for the first quarter. Importantly there are no indications for a fall in net issuance ahead, and we should not expect one, as the US deficit remains far too high. Moreover, there is no plan in Congress to get it materially lower. Markets are parking the issuance pressure story here in favor of a focus on interest rate cuts as the big theme for 2024. But once the novelty of rate cuts wears off, markets will realize that the issuance pressure has not gone away. This ultimately will place upward pressure on market rates. The interest rate-fueled bull market ahead should morph to a bear market for the back end should we indeed achieve a soft landing with lower front-end rates. But that's for later.Nobody expects the Bank to change policy on Thursday. Yet, when the BoE changes its language to drop any suggestion that the policy rate could rise further it will be a dovish shift, even if it leaves references to policy needing to stay sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long and staying restrictive for an extended period in place. The market may be far ahead, pricing already 115bp in cuts for this year starting as early as May and it may limit the further downside to rates, but the Banks evolution of language is a move in the dovish direction.Pushback could probably come more indirectly via the Banks inflation forecasts. That would be the case if the two-year inflation forecast would still come in a little above 2% in the update, indicating that the rally in market rates since the November release is offsetting disinflationary effects on this horizon.The final factor to watch is the voting split, which could be used by hawks to display their dissent by still voting for a hike  or on the dovish end a vote for a cut. Our economist's base case is a 9-0 vote to hold after the 6-3 vote in December.Downside surprises in French and German inflation releases took the edge off the wider eurozone flash CPI release on Thursday. The consensus has it at 2.7% year-on-year in the headline and 3.2% in core. We will also get manufacturing PMIs for Spain and Italy alongside the final eurozone figure, as well as the eurozone unemployment rate.Notable US data releases for Thursday are the initial jobless claims as well as the ISM manufacturing. The former are seen staying above 200k and the latter to stay softer in the headline, but with minor increases in employment, new orders and prices paid sub-components.Thursdays Eurozone govie supply slate is busy with French 10 to 30Y (up to 13bn) and Spanish 5 to 10Y plus linker auctions ( up to 7.25bn in total).Disclaimer:

Investing.com,Gold Price Stays High Despite a Hawkish Fed; EUR/USD Drops to a 2-Month Low,2024-02-01,0.333333,"The gold (XAU) price rose above 2,050 on Wednesday but failed to hold the level and decreased after Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair, said the rate cut in March was unlikely.Yesterday, the US central bank left interest rates unchanged, but Powell pushed back strongly against expectations of a rate reduction in March. He stated that it wasn't the Fed's baseline scenario and that none of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members suggested cutting rates. He also added that the regulator needs more confidence in the inflation slowdown. Predictably, the Fed's hawkish message immediately lowered the probability of a 25 basis point (bps) rate reduction to less than 36% at the next meeting.In theory, the US interest rate staying high for longer should exert bearish pressure on gold. Although
XAU/USD
lost most of its gains yesterday, it didn't sell off sharply and now continues to trade near 2-week highs. One possible reason the pair remained stable is that investors' long-term interest rate expectations remain predominantly dovish. The market continues to anticipate more than 140 bps worth of rate cuts from the Fed in 2024 and a 36% probability of a 50-bps rate reduction in May. Furthermore, yesterday's ADP Employment numbers were lower than expected, possibly strengthening the market's belief that the Fed may need to cut rates sooner rather than later.XAU/USD was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, gold traders should pay attention to US macroeconomic reports for any details contradicting or supporting the Fed's recent statement. The most important reports to watch are Jobless Claims at 1:30 p.m. UTC and ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 3:00 p.m. UTC. If reports come out stronger than expectedjobless claims rise only slightly, or PMI exceeds forecastXAU/USD may drop sharply. Otherwise, the bullish trend in gold may continue.The euro (EUR) declined by 0.23% yesterday and reached its lowest point since 13 December, following hawkish comments from Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair.EUR/USD
is heading for a 2.2% drop this month, recording its poorest monthly performance since September. The
US dollar
strengthened on Wednesday following Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell's indication that a March rate cut is not on the cards. The Fed offered a more neutral stance on interest rates than anticipated by many investors. In a press conference, Jerome Powell mentioned that the regulator needs more data to ensure that the decelerating inflation data reflects the economic trend to proceed with rate reductions confidently. 'We do have confidence, but we want to get greater confidence', he stated.Overall, Jerome Powell dismissed the possibility of an interest rate cut in March. Still, the
US Dollar Index
failed to set a new high. The likelihood of the March rate reduction now stands at less than 36%, a decrease from 73% a month earlier. Meanwhile, Wednesday's data revealed that inflation in Germany decreased to 3.1% in January due to a decline in energy prices. Soft economic growth and lower inflation figures from the eurozone could heighten expectations for soon monetary policy easing from the European Central Bank (ECB), potentially bringing EUR/USD lower.EUR/USD was falling slightly during the early European trading session. Today, traders should pay attention to the eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) report at 10:00 a.m. UTC. If the data supports yesterday's German CPI report by being lower than expected, EUR/USD may plunge sharplypossibly towards 1.07500. However, higher-than-expected numbers may slightly support EUR bulls.The British pound lost 0.09% on Wednesday as the US dollar strengthened after a hawkish statement from the Federal Reserve (Fed).The US central bank almost completely excluded the possibility of a rate cut in March, which should have sharply brought
GBP/USD
down. However, the market was prepared for this outcome, so the reaction was relatively muted. Still, the sentiment in GBP/USD seems to be getting more bearish as the pair is breaking out of its month-long trading range. The focus now shifts towards the Bank of England's (BOE) policy rate decision later today. Fundamentally, the U.K. economy is less prepared for the rate cut because inflation is higher than in the US, above the 2% target. However, the sentiment within the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which determines the monetary policy path, may be shifting towards a more dovish stance. Three of the MPC's nine policymakers voted for a further rate increase in December, as a stagnant economy had failed to cool rapid wage growth. This time, their stance could be less hawkish.GBP/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, GBP traders should expect increased volatility as the calendar is packed with many important releases. First, the BOE will declare its verdict on monetary policy at 12:00 p.m. UTC, followed by the press conference at 12:30 p.m. UTC. Traders should watch for any shifts in the regulator's tone in the monetary policy statement and MPC vote distribution. Later today, the US will release two important macroeconomic reports: Jobless Claims at 1:30 p.m. UTC and the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 3:00 p.m. UTC. Weak reports might support the British pound, but only if the BOE decision doesn't surprise investors by being excessively dovish. Technically, GBP/USD will probably remain under bearish pressure until the price stays below the important 1.27000 level."
Investing.com,US Dollar May Start Weakening Earlier Than Usual on Weak Unemployment Data,2024-02-01,0.333333,"The U.S. Labour Department will be reporting on Friday, 2 February. The Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) is expected to increase by 180,000 jobs in January. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 3.8% from 3.7% in December.Historically, financial market participants look to U.S. consumer inflation data and U.S. labour market data to predict the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Consumer inflation expectations for the next 12 months fell to 5.2%, down from 5.5% in December. When viewed through the lens of consumer price changes, the perception of a recession has weakened further this year. However, the weak labour market is increasingly in the spotlight in the soft landing debate as hiring stalls and layoffs increase. Meanwhile, unemployment is at an all-time low of 3.7%.Nascent problems in the U.S. labour market could trigger earlier stimulus from the Fed. If so, when the U.S. labour market data is released this Friday, traders should focus on the trading opportunity of a weakening
US dollar
against all major asset groups. For foreign currency traders, it means the
USDJPY
is likely to fall. The main target is 141.00142.00."
Investing.com,Fed Needs More Time to Tame the Inflation Fire It Started,2024-02-01,0.333333,"Part One of this series led with a graph implying that we are embarking on an inflation rollercoaster for the next ten years, similar to the experience of 1965 to 1982.Parts One and Two explained the causes and remedies for that prolonged inflation outbreak. The links are below.Part OnePart TwoWith the history lesson behind us, we move on to the recent inflation that kicked off in conjunction with the pandemic. This summary allows us to appreciate better the similarities and differences between now and fifty years ago.Bear in mind many other governments, companies, and citizens reacted to the pandemic similarly. As a result, our
inflation
was further amplified by their actions.We start with two graphs from the San Francisco Fed. The graphs quantify and attribute the sources of inflation to supply and demand side forces. The first graph shows the contributions year-over-year, while the second shows the monthly impacts.The graphs show that the contribution to inflation was
both
supply- and demand-driven. Lets now break down the unique supply and demand forces driving inflation.The global economy began shuttering as Covid fears spread worldwide in March 2020.Consequently, the
unemployment rate
rose from 3.5% in February to 14.8% in April. Not only was the unemployment rate the highest in 75 years, but the speed at which it climbed dwarfed any other period on record.To stress that point, consider that during the Great Depression, the unemployment rate peaked at 25%, but the increase from single digits happened over four years, not two months.Except for some instances during the World Wars, never in recent history has the U.S. and global economy been as trade restricted. The graph below, courtesy of the Financial Times, shows the extraordinary pace at which global trade contracted.We highlight the domestic auto industry to demonstrate how a lack of production led to inflation.In April 2020, the U.S. produced a mere 17,100 cars, as shown below. That is less than 10% of the monthly pre-pandemic average of over 200k.Despite the pandemic, workers returned to the assembly lines relatively quickly, and production picked up rapidly.However, after the initial bounce in production, it started declining again. By mid-2021, new car production was running at half the pre-pandemic rate.This resulted from a shortage of critical chips and other vital components. Like other industries, the auto industry had to limit production due to shortfalls in other sectors.The graph above shows how lessened production severely reduced inventories, thus pushing prices significantly higher.The inventory of new cars fell by over 80% from late 2020 through 2022. To this day, inventories remain well short of pre-pandemic averages. The shortage of chips is also still a problem!Used cars were heavily affected. With fewer new cars available, those needing a vehicle shopped the used car markets.Demand overran supply, and used car prices soared, as highlighted below.Further dampening the supply of used cars, many used car owners, despite higher prices, were not willing to sell. How would they replace their car?The auto industry was typical of many industries that experienced severe shortages in units for sale and parts required to make new units.Consumers were shocked when the pandemic started, and typical consumption habits changed drastically. Some people braved going to the grocery store and stocked up on essentials.The activity was like what we often see before significant weather events. Demand for goods online soared. The rapidly changing proportion of goods going to stores versus directly to consumers further distorted supply lines.Initially, purchases of non-essential goods and most services fell sharply. As shown below, essential goods, like toilet paper, were in high demand.The demand surge led to toilet paper shortages. Producers could not satisfy the increased demand as the production and transportation limitations further impacted the shortage.As we shared with auto production, this is one example of many instances.As the pandemic became the norm, consumption behaviors started to change. Some people began to consume more than was normal for them.This was driven by increased savings, as we will discuss, and a growing desire to reward ourselves for enduring a painful period.A YOLO (you only live once) mentality started to thrive. Somewhat like a near-death experience, those emerging from worry started to spend and live for the day.Some people could shake the fear of COVID early, while it lingered for others. Such had the effect of staggering and prolonging demand surges.Behavioral changes can be impactful on consumption patterns, but they need to be accompanied by how to consume.For that, we have Uncle Sam to thank. Enhanced jobless benefits, two direct checks from the government, student loan relief, and countless other fiscal benefits supported consumer finances.For example, consider the third of six pandemic relief packages. The $2.3 trillion CARES Act of March 27, 2020, provided monetary relief as follows:As a result of record fiscal spending, personal savings soared.Further bolstering savings for some were limitations put upon expenditures such as the closure of restaurants, movie theaters, and cruise lines.As shown below, the rise in savings and the rate at which it was saved was well beyond any prior instance.Initially, the increased savings/lower consumption kept inflation low. However, shortly after, our bulging savings accounts became fodder for spending.Personal savings are now below pre-pandemic levels, indicating that a large chunk of excess savings has primarily been spent.Consumption is a function of wealth, financial conditions, and confidence. The following comes from an editorial by Ben Bernanke in the Washington Post:The Fed flooded liquidity into the financial markets, bringing rates to zero percent and providing ample opportunity for the Treasury to fund massive deficits at dirt-cheap interest rates.TALF, PPPLF, PMCCF, SMCCF, MSLP, MLF, PDCF, and MMLF were just some of the many programs the Fed reopened from the 2008 financial crisis or created for the occasion.These programs bailed out investors and markets that were on the cusp of failing.Despite a weak economy and high unemployment rate, the
S&P 500
hit record highs by October. Consumers had plenty of money in savings and were gaining confidence quickly.Like the 70s era inflation, the recent inflation outbreak resulted from the government and Feds not well thought out tactics.Initially, significant monetary and fiscal stimulus was. However, blame can be placed on the Fed and government for continuing such tactics well after the economy was rapidly recovering.The graphs below help show the amount and duration of the monetary and fiscal stimulus.Not only did the Fed drop rates to zero and leave them there for over two years, but they bought $5 billion in assets. Such was almost five times what they purchased when the banking system was collapsing in 2008.The result was a surge in the money supply, dwarfing that of the 70s.The government kept spending despite a robust economic recovery with quickly rising inflation.The graph below shows the government ran a $2 trillion deficit in just one quarter in 2020. Since then, almost every quarterly deficit has been larger than during the last recession.The Fed and government turned the liquidity spigots on and were very slow to reduce their flow. The spending provided for a surge in demand. At the same time, production was limited, and supply lines were ailing.The resulting inflation was due to the Feds and governments overstimulation and limited supply. Such is the Economics 101 textbook definition of inflation.The trillion-dollar question is how much of the changes in supply and demand were solely due to the pandemic.With a better appreciation of the causes of inflation in the 1970s and early 2020s, we can finally draw some conclusions about whether more rounds of inflation are likely.With Parts One, Two, and Three in the bag, stay tuned for this seriess fourth and final part."
Investing.com,Tech Stocks Tumble,2024-02-01,0.222222,"We knew that yesterday was not going to be a bright day, as Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
), Google (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) and AMD (NASDAQ:
AMD
) have all seen a negative market reaction to their fantastic quarterly results that failed to match the huge market expectations. And because most investors have been waiting in ambush for the slightest misstep to take advantage of selling the overstretched tech rally, the tech stocks got hammered after Microsofts light guidance for the current quarter. Microsoft fell more than 2.5% from a record high, Google tumbled more than 7%, AMD lost 2.5% and Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) retreated about 2%.Yesterdays tech selloff was broadly expected before the session opened. What was not expected however was a surprise Q4 loss at New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:
NYCB
)  which slashed its dividend following its asset purchases from the bankrupt Signature Bank led to higher loan-loss provisions and charge-offs. The bank also warned of building trouble in the office-space sector. New York Community Bancorp (NASDAQ:
CTBI
) shares tumbled near 38% yesterday, bringing back the worries regarding the US regional banks, the commercial real estate threat, and the possibility of seeing other small regional players go into trouble. As such, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:
KRE
) sold off nearly 6%, and even big banks which have largely benefited from the regional banks misfortune last year traded down.Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
), Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
), and Facebooks Meta (NASDAQ:
META
) will post results after the bell today. Theyd better blow investors minds. Otherwise, the tech selloff is poised to gather momentum  despite the falling yields.Resurfacing worries of another potential bank stress sent the US yields tumbling yesterday. The
US 2-year
yield tipped a toe below 4.20%, and the
10-year
yield sank below 4% on a weaker-than-expected ADP report, lower than expected employment cost in Q4, on news that US Treasury will stop increasing the size of its auctions starting from May, and of course on fear that another bank stress could hurt the US growth and get the Federal Reserve (Fed) to hurry up on cutting rates to calm down the market nerves. But we are not there just yet!The Fed kept its rates unchanged at yesterdays meeting as expected, they removed the statement that talked about additional policy firming and replaced it with rate cuts wont be appropriate until the committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.More importantly, Jay Powell hinted at a slowdown in the pace of QT in the foreseeable future. And thats a big deal, as unwinding QT will leave the market with more liquidity than otherwise, and all that extra liquidity that is not sucked away could continue to be in the financial markets and support asset prices. In summary, we may not see a rate cut right away, but a slowing QT sounds better for relaxing the financial conditions and asset valuations than your regular rate cuts. Whats sure is that the Fed will never ever be able to pull out the GFC and pandemic liquidity out of the market. Ever. Enjoy.Coming back to rates, Powell wanted it to be clear to everyone that a rate cut in March is Unlikely. Still, activity on Fed fund futures gives around a 65% chance for a March rate cut as yesterdays bank worries play in favor of a sooner rather than a later rate cut. But remember, the last time the US went through a decent banking stress, the US economy didnt slow. Or if did, it still eked out an above-average growth.In the FX, the
US dollar
swung between gains and losses yesterday and is slightly above its 200-DMA at the wake of the latest Fed decision. The
EUR/USD
extended losses to the 1.08 psychological mark as French and German inflation figures were soft enough to keep inflation worries and the European Central Bank (ECB) hawks at bay. With both the ECB and Fed meetings out of the way, the next natural target for the euro bears is the 100-DMA which stands at 1.0775.Across the Channel, the Bank of England (BoE) will give its latest policy verdict today. British policymakers will likely push back on early rate cut expectations after the latest inflation numbers in the UK revealed a mini U-turn in easing price dynamics. But Brits are expected to deliver a brighter outlook for their economy, lower inflation forecasts and open the door for rate cuts later this year.The sharp fall in US yields amid the mounting US regional bank worries sent the 10-year gilt yield below the 3.80% level yesterday, but gilts had their worst month since May, the
FTSE 100
recorded its first drop since October, and
sterling
topped at 1.2830 against the greenback. Improved economic forecasts and a balanced hawkish tone should contain the selling pressure in sterling, but
Cable
is more likely to test 1.25 than 1.30 in the foreseeable future."
Investing.com,"Fed Chair Powell Deems March Rate Cut Unlikely, Boosting US Dollar",2024-02-01,0.333333,"The Federal Reserves FOMC left interest rates unchanged in the 5.25-5.50% range, as expected.There were no changes to the central banks balance sheet plans.This is the fourth consecutive meeting where the Fed left interest rates unchanged.For the first time in months, the FOMC made multiple substantive updates to its monetary policy statement. Among the most significant changes were the following:All told, these tweaks show that Jerome Powell and Company are considering the timing of shifting to interest rate cuts, but for a market that has been positioned for interest rate cuts to start at the next Fed meeting in March, these tweaks were less dovish than expected, suggesting that the interest rate cutting cycle may start later than many traders were anticipating.Source: Federal Reserve, StoneXFed Chairman Powell is still winding down his comments as we go to press, but so far he has struck a relatively balanced, data-dependent tone.Highlights from his press conference follow (
emphasis
mine):It was shaping up to be another ""ho-hum"" press conference until toward the end, when the Chairman dropped the relatively explicit comment that he didn't think an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in March was likely. While not an absolute pre-committal, waiting until May to start cutting interest rates would be later than almost any trader expected heading into the year, and it may set the stage for delays at other major central banks around the globe.After some early volatility on the seemingly more-dovish-than-expected monetary policy statement, most major markets were settling in near where their pre-Fed prices before Mr. Powell expressed skepticism over a March rate cut.Now as we go to press, the
US dollar
is rallying by 30-50 pips against most of its major rivals, and major indices are trading at their session lows.Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether economic data will continue to move in the direction the Fed hopes, but it's clear that inflation and jobs figures will be particularly significant over the next few months as the Fed dials in the exact timeline for starting its easing cycle.Original Post"

MSFT
) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) Inc. reported better than expected earnings, after hours and then with follow-up during the trading session, sellers came out to lock in gains or perhaps go short.After all, tech has done much of the markets heavy lifting to date.The earnings were already priced in.And, as per the title of this Daily, many retail investors began to see the light ahead of the FOMC that logically, FED would pause and not get too dovish.The wisest traders stopped buying big tech ahead of the earnings.And the wiser started selling after hours and into the early part of the day.The wise may remain in their positions but should at least have profitable trailing stops in place.What can we make from both the gap down in
Nasdaq
and the FOMC bullet points?Looking at the
NASDAQ futures
chart-Not horrible, as although it traded lower on the day, it did not leave a gap between Tuesdays close and Wednesday's highs.What we can see is that 17,535 area is now resistance to clear and if does, the immediate impact of the drop in NASDAQ prices could easily become a one-day affair.However, we must remain open to the idea that NASDAQ does not clear resistance and has had its run for now.As for the impact on the FOMC announcement-Some of the highlights with my comments: FOMC Does Not Expect to Reduce Rates Until It Has ""Greater Confidence"" Inflation Moving Toward 2%
(Good luck with that considering 2% is not realistic especially if one considers a growing economy, let alone government spending, debt, geopolitics and so on) FOMC Judges Risks to Achieving Employment, Inflation Goals Moving Into Better Balance
(In a perfect world best case scenario or what folks call normalization where inflation and fed funds rates are aligned and the economy is humming along) FOMC: ""Any Adjustments"" to Rates To Be Based On Incoming Data, Evolving Outlook, Balance of Risks
(That is assuming they can stay ahead of the curve and not left behind the 8-ball if any crisis occurs)FOMC ""Highly Attentive"" to Inflation Risks, Says Economic Outlook Is Uncertain

Investing.com,Natural Gas Price Outlook,2024-02-02,0.333333,"From last week till today there was a noteworthy drop in
Natural Gas Futures
prices  from $2.2 to $2 for a MMBTU. However, I foresee that the price may become even lower. With a sharp reduction of exports, the price of gas will fall to the range of $1.5 - 1.8.
What are the main reasons for this price decrease? Between 2009 and 2022, the drilling speed saw a fivefold increase. The studied area has expanded, allowing for precise well modeling. Moreover, equipment productivity and capacity have risen, accompanied by a reduction in equipment costs. Consequently, the expense of drillhole construction has halved, while productivity has surged ten times.
The new low price will stop both the introduction of new wells and drilling increase. And accordingly, there will be a cut in production for the month and price stabilization. The excess gas will be pumped into the underground storage. The injection can be kept there for a month and during this period there will be a decline in production. Subsequently, in spite of the current drop, we can expect the average gas price in 2024 in the United States at the level of $2.6 - 2.8 for a MMBtu."
Investing.com,"US Dollar, Gold Relationship With Silver Could Indicate Next Market Direction",2024-02-02,0.666667,"As FOMC rides into the sunset until March, the
US Dollar Index
is left to fend for itself amid the hawkish (or at least not yet dovish) echos of Jerome Powells assertion that the market should not expect rate cuts in March. Well duh, we know that already, sir.The only benefit the
US dollar
would be left with, assuming the not yet dovish policy does not turn hawkish again, would be the potential for a counter-party bid.An impulsive bid by risk-soaked casino patrons suddenly jerking to a safe haven. Which USD surely is, much like
gold
. The difference being that
USD is a safe haven tool
as long as public confidence in debt paper remains.
Gold is a safe value haven
, long-term.As a tool and with the herds confidence implied to be intact, by virtue of its global reserve status USD receives incoming (forced) investment when herds flee the asset racket, which has been set up counter the US dollar by decades of US and global inflationary monetary policy.Yet here we find a recent disconnect between stocks (
S&P 500
and global, ex-US) and inverse USD. Either USD is going to drop (inverse rise back in line with stocks) or just maybe we might have the start of something important in the form of a fundamental change of character in the macro markets.That could mean market rotation, a stock bear market (SPX has finally joined the new all-time highs! contingent, after all, a preferred ingredient to making a sentiment-fueled top) or, if USD continues to bounce (inverse continues to drop) even a slippery slope into a market liquidation (again, reference all that soft landing, no landing Goldilocks consensus out there in the mainstream financial media for a potential contrary setup).The Gold/Silver ratio (GSR) is still perched constructively to attend USD upward, after all. If gold were to rise impulsively vs. silver the inflation trades would be off and the market liquidation trades could be on.Silver
is less monetary, more speculative, and more cyclical/inflation-sensitive than gold. If the GSR breaks down from this constructive perch, the inflation trades would benefit.Moving on, lets take a brief look at the technical status of the anti-market, the US dollar index (DXY). Much like the bull trap from September to November felt like it took forever and a day to resolve, todays meeting with resistance is a persistent little bugger.Grinding, chewing, and instigating to take out resistance at 103.50. As advised to my subscribers several weeks ago, the key level to exceed and hold (for USD to go bullish) is the December high at 104.27. But first USD is buzz-sawing the resistance area and the important daily SMA 200.The weekly chart provides the perspective that a level of caution, for inflation traders, is provided by the fact that the index held a higher low to the bear trap low with the bounce starting from clear long-term support.If the US dollar index fails to make a higher high to the December high and instead turns down (and silver leads gold upward), then the broad rally can continue, especially in the more traditional inflation trades like commodities and equities that produce commodities/resources, and resource-rich regions within Emerging Markets.If the US dollar index takes out the December high and holds it, and the Gold/Silver ratio follows its current constructive pattern upward, you might want to do a thorough check of the investment pool. The might be a turd in there!To add a third dynamic, there was a blessed phase from 2001 to 2004 when the Gold/Silver ratio rose (non-impulsively), the US dollar declined and the gold mining sector had its most fundamentally pure macro backdrop for years previous and now 20 years since. After that commodities and stock markets rallied as well and the gold miners entered a bubble amid degrading fundamentals. But even a 2 to 3-year phase would be quite profitable."
Investing.com,2 Reasons Why February May Be a Difficult Month on Wall Street,2024-02-02,0.666667,"After a relatively strong start to the year in January, history says investors should brace for fresh turmoil in February, which has a reputation for being one of the worst months of the year for the stock market.Since 1945, the
S&P 500
has suffered an average loss of around -0.3% in February.That compares to an average gain of roughly +0.8% for the other months of the calendar. The benchmark index fell -2.6% last February as investors worried about the Federal Reserves aggressive rate hike plans.Indeed, the Fed is still the main driver of investor sentiments and stock price action, with many speculating recently about when the U.S. central bank might start cutting interest rates.As of this writing, after today's surprisingly above-estimate jobs report, which showed that the U.S. economy had added 353,000 jobs against an estimate of 187,000 in January, financial markets saw about a 65% chance of the Fed leaving rates at current levels in March, compared to a 35% probability of a quarter-point rate cut.Speaking at the post-meeting press conference on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted the labor market and economic growth may need to slow to ultimately achieve the Feds goal of bringing inflation back down to its 2% target.Looking out to May, investors believe there is a roughly 90% chance rates are lower by the end of that meeting, as per the Investing.com
Fed Rate Monitor Tool
.With investors continuing to gauge the outlook for interest rates,
inflation
, and the economy, a lot will be on the line in the month ahead.The U.S. government will release the January
CPI
report on Tuesday, February 13, at 8:30AM ET and the numbers will likely show that prices continue to increase at a pace nearly twice the central banks target.While no official forecasts have been set yet, expectations for annual CPI range from an increase of 3.2% to 3.6%, compared to a 3.4% annual pace in December.The closely watched consumer price index has come down substantially since the summer of 2022, when it peaked at a four-decade high of 9.1%, however, inflation is still rising far more quickly than the 2% rate the Fed considers healthy.Meanwhile, estimates for the year-on-year
core CPI
figure - which does not include food and energy prices - center around 3.7%-4.0%, compared to Decembers 3.9% reading.The underlying core figure is closely watched by Fed officials who believe that it provides a more accurate assessment of the future direction of inflation.Prediction:
I believe the numbers will likely show that neither inflation nor core inflation is falling fast enough for the Fed to pause its inflation-fighting efforts.During Wednesdays post-FOMC meeting press conference,
Powell
said that rate cuts would not be appropriate until there is ""greater confidence that inflation is moving"" towards the central bank's 2% target.Therefore, I hold the opinion that the current environment is not indicative of a Fed that will need to pivot on policy and there is still a long way to go before policymakers are ready to declare mission accomplished on the inflation front.Investors await a flood of earnings in February as Wall Streets fourth quarter reporting season continues.Three of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks reported their results last night, with Facebook-parent

Investing.com,US Stocks Expected to Drag Down Global Market Returns,2024-02-02,0.666667,"The long-term return forecast for the Global Market Index (GMI) continued to ease in January, dipping to an annualized 6.6% total return, based on the average for three models (defined below).GMI is a market-value-weighted portfolio that holds all the
major asset classes
(except cash) via a set of ETF proxies.Todays revised performance estimate marks another fractionally lower forecast vs. the
previous months outlook
.Once again, the ex-ante return for US stocks is the conspicuous outlier: the average return forecast is well below the trailing
10-year
performance.American equities, in sum, are expected to deliver materially lower returns relative to the past decade.By contrast, the rest of the major asset classes reflect performance forecasts above their respective trailing 10-year results.Meanwhile, GMI is currently projected to generate a return thats in line with its trailing 10-year performance of 6.6%.GMI represents a theoretical benchmark of the optimal portfolio for the average investor with an infinite time horizon.On that basis, GMI is useful as a
starting point
for customizing asset allocation and portfolio design to match an investors expectations, objectives, risk tolerance, etc.GMIs history suggests that this passive benchmarks performance is competitive with most active asset-allocation strategies, especially after adjusting for risk, trading costs and taxes.Its likely that some, most or possibly all of the forecasts above will be wide of the mark in some degree. GMIs projections, however, are expected to be somewhat more reliable vs. the estimates for its components.Predictions for the specific markets (US stocks, commodities, etc.) are subject to greater volatility and tracking error compared with aggregating the forecasts into the GMI estimate, a process that may reduce some of the errors through time.For context on how GMIs realized total return has evolved through time, consider the benchmarks track record on a rolling 10-year annualized basis.The chart below compares GMIs performance vs. the equivalent for US stocks and US bonds through last month.GMIs current return for the past ten years is 6.6%, which is moderately above the recent low for this time window.Heres a brief summary of how the forecasts are generated and definitions of the other metrics in the table above:BB:
The Building Block model uses historical returns as a proxy for estimating the future.The sample period used starts in January 1998 (the earliest available date for all the asset classes listed above).The procedure is to calculate the risk premium for each asset class, compute the annualized return and then add an expected risk-free rate to generate a total return forecast.For the expected risk-free rate, were using the latest yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS). This yield is considered a market estimate of a risk-free, real (inflation-adjusted) return for a safe asset 
this risk-free rate is also used for all the models outlined below.Note that the BB model used here is (loosely) based on a methodology originally outlined by Ibbotson Associates (a division of Morningstar).EQ:
The Equilibrium model reverse engineers expected return by way of risk. Rather than trying to predict return directly, this model relies on the somewhat more reliable framework of using risk metrics to estimate future performance.The process is relatively robust in the sense that forecasting risk is slightly easier than projecting return. The three inputs:This model for estimating equilibrium returns was initially outlined in a 1974 paper by Professor Bill Sharpe. For a summary, see Gary Brinsons explanation in Chapter 3 of The Portable MBA in Investment. I also review the model in my book Dynamic Asset Allocation. Note that this methodology initially estimates a risk premium and then adds an expected risk-free rate to arrive at total return forecasts. The expected risk-free rate is outlined in BB above.ADJ:
This methodology is identical to the Equilibrium model (EQ) outlined above
with one exception:
the forecasts are adjusted based on short-term momentum and longer-term mean reversion factors. Momentum is defined as the current price relative to the trailing 12-month moving average. The mean reversion factor is estimated as the current price relative to the trailing 60-month (5-year) moving average.The equilibrium forecasts are adjusted based on current prices relative to the 12-month and 60-month moving averages. If current prices are above (below) the moving averages, the unadjusted risk premia estimates are decreased (increased). The formula for adjustment is simply taking the inverse of the average of the current price to the two moving averages.For example: if an asset classs current price is 10% above its 12-month moving average and 20% over its 60-month moving average, the unadjusted forecast is reduced by 15% (the average of 10% and 20%). The logic here is that when prices are relatively high vs. recent history, the equilibrium forecasts are reduced. On the flip side, when prices are relatively low vs. recent history, the equilibrium forecasts are increased.Avg:

XAU/USD
rose nearly 2% this week, driven by a weakening
US dollar
, Treasury yields, and prospects of US rate cuts this year.Gold approached a 1-month high yesterday following the release of higher-than-expected US weekly jobless claims. The Labour Department reported that initial jobless claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 224,000 for the week ending 27 January. It's the largest increase in 2 months, suggesting the labour market is weakening and raising the possibility of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed). Still, the data indicated that US worker productivity in Q4 exceeded expectations.At its last meeting, the Fed maintained interest rates unchanged but dismissed the possibility of rate cuts this spring. According to the CME Fed Watch tool, the market now foresees a 96% probability of the first rate cut in May. Despite a lingering 'bad hangover' from the Fed's monetary policy stance, gold is rising slightly due to the higher-than-expected US jobless claims numbers, noted Phillip Streible, a chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures. A report showing US lender New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:
NYCB
) is facing financial troubles also affected market sentiment. The reports reminded investors of a regional banking crisis in March 2023. Thus, the appeal of safe-haven assets like bullion increased.XAU/USD was essentially unchanged in Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders should focus on the US Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report at 1:30 p.m. UTC. The report usually causes high volatility in the Forex market. If average hourly earnings rise, unemployment drops, or the number of jobs created is higher than expected, XAU/USD may decline and possibly return to 2,032. However, any indications that the US labour market is weakening may invigorate XAU/USD bulls, driving the pair towards 2,090. 'Spot gold may retest resistance at 2,066 USD per ounce, probably after a shallow correction into the 2,0422,047 USD range,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.The
euro
(EUR) gained 0.52% on Thursday following data that indicated persistent underlying price pressure in the eurozone.Thursday's data revealed that inflation in the eurozone in January softened as anticipated, but the decrease in core price pressures was not as significant as projected. This data may prompt the European Central Bank (ECB) to adopt a more cautious approach to interest rate reductions. Therefore, market expectations of the interest rate cut by the ECB in April might be overly optimistic despite easing inflation in France and Germany. Another factor contributing to the strengthening of EUR/USD was higher-than-expected US jobless claims numbers. The US dollar also faced downward pressure due to improved risk appetite, as indicated by a global rebound in equity markets.Today, EUR/USD rose slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Market participants are now focusing on the upcoming US Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report at 1:30 p.m. UTC to assess the labour market's state and adjust their expectations for the US interest rate path. Lower-than-expected figures will probably push EUR/USD towards 1.09100. However, EUR/USD may correct downwards if NFP figures are higher than expected.Yesterday, the
Australian dollar
(AUD) dropped to the 0.65000 level on the back of soft inflation figures. Still, it recovered swiftly during the American trading session as US jobless claims figures were higher than expected.AUD/USD has been trading in a relatively tight range of 0.650000.66200 for over 2 weeks. Investors have been struggling to figure out what might be the best big move in the pair. Interest rate expectations in Australia and the US have been changing sharply lately. There is a lot of uncertainty about when exactly the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) might deliver their first rate cuts. The RBA is scheduled to hold its policy meeting on 6 February. The regulator will probably keep the rates at 4.35%, given the better-than-expected latest inflation report.Similarly, investors expect the Fed to leave its base rate unchanged until May. Fundamentally, considering the long-term expectations, the market favours AUD over USD. According to the latest interest rate swap market data, investors price in 140 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts from the Fed and only 60 bps worth of rate reductions from the RBA by the end of 2024.AUD/USD was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, all eyes will be on the US Nonfarm Payroll report at 1:30 p.m. UTC. This report is the most anticipated event, causing increased volatility in the market. Traders will specifically focus on monthly changes in average hourly earnings and the unemployment rate. If the report generally comes out better than expected, indicating a robust US labour market, AUD/USD will drop and may attempt to retest 0.65000. Disappointing data may prolong the bullish trend in AUD/USD, possibly driving the pair towards 0.66500."
Investing.com,Fed's Jobs Data Dilemma,2024-02-02,0.666667,"The Bank of England (BoE) kept its rates unchanged yesterday but opened the door to rate cuts mentioning good news on inflation.
Cable
rebounded despite a dovish takeaway from the MPC meeting as the US dollar fell sharply despite better-than-expected ISM manufacturing survey. In the euro area, inflation fell slower than expected in January. Combined with a softer
US dollar
, the
EUR/USD
jumped from 1.0780, a few pips above the 100-DMA. The Swedish Riksbank also held rates steady yesterday and gave the happy news that a rate cut will be coming in H1.The year starts with the sweet smell of the upcoming interest rate cuts, like a freshly baked apple pie ready to come out of the oven. We cant wait to have a taste of it before the commercial real estate dives into darkness with more than half of commercial loans in the US due to come to maturity by the end of 2025  and these loans make up to almost 30% of the small banks assets. So, lets hope that the Fed wont burn the pie.The US is expected to have added less than 200K jobs this January, for around the same pay growth of 4.1% and the unemployment rate is seen ticking slightly higher to 3.8%. A reasonably weak number should revive the Federal Reserve (Fed) doves, while a strong number should melt the March rate cut expectations. The probability of a March hike fell to 35% after the Fed said that March was probably too early to cut rates  while this probability was around 80% at the start of the year. Everyone is focused on the May meeting now, with more than 90% probability priced in for the first Fed cut.The rationale with the jobs data is, the softer the data, the sooner the Fed could start cutting rates. And with the number of layoff news on the newswire, it looks safe to bet that todays NFP will be as soft as Wednesdays ADP report. But note that Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that they sense that the US economy is accelerating based on anecdotes and chats with the private sector. And thats not in line with the layoff news that crowd the headlines. A reasonably soft jobs data is good for the Fed doves and should further weigh on the US dollar, a stronger-than-expected figure  if not abnormally strong - should not impact the May cut expectations and keep the dollar bulls contained.Three US tech giants revealed their Q4 results yesterday after the bell and the results were mixed. Meta (NASDAQ:
META
) jumped 15% in the after-hours trading  the kind of post-earnings move we love to see - after its revenue jumped 25% compared to the same time a year ago. The company gave a bright sales forecast and announced a $50bn buyback and its first-ever dividend of 50 cents starting from March. As such, Meta will jump past the $400 per share at open and hit a fresh record. What a comeback!Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) gained a bit more than 2.5% after reporting strong sales and gave a better-than-expected operating income. AWS made only 13% more compared to the same time last year and thats well shy of Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
) and Googles, but its not about how much you grow but how much you grow compared to expectations; the 13% growth was well-digested. Amazon could extend gains and eventually return to its long-term ascending base. Amazon lacks colour compared to its Magnificent 7 buddies which run from record to record. But the company has the potential to develop its cloud business and integrate AI on it.Less enthusiastic, Apple shares (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) almost 3% in the after-hours trading as sales in China dropped 13%. The company, however, returned to growth after four quarters of contraction and overall iPhone sales were beat. But investors couldnt get over the worsening outlook in China. Maybe its time for Apple to look for another milk cow. India, maybe?Today, Exxon (NYSE:
XOM
) and Chevron (NYSE:
CVX
) are due to announce how well they did last quarter. Yesterday, Shell announced a $28bn profit and $3.5bn share buyback. The $28bn is much lower than the $40bn the company announced in stellar 2022  after Russia invaded Ukraine, and oils inability to gain sustainable positive momentum remains a headache for oil revenues, but Shell (LON:
SHEL
) jumped 2% after the results, OPEC signaled that it will keep oil restrictions intact until the end of this year, and

Investing.com,Want to Know When the Fed Cuts Rates? Watch the Consumers,2024-02-05,0.666667,"The probability of interest rate cuts has many market participants pondering whether 2024 will bring a bull market for precious metals.Gold
has held up quite well despite the Feds tightening cycle, gaining 13% in 2023.The Federal Reserves current interest-rate pause, due to successfully lowering inflation, and subsequent pivot to reducing interest rates, likely in mid-2024, is good news for commodities.Lower rates will cause the
dollar
to fall and commodity prices to rise. When positive real interest rates, which favor bond investors, turn negative, it will especially affect gold prices to the upside.Ive been right in my prediction that the Fed would pause in June, 2023, and hike once or twice more before the end of the year.Ive also voiced my opinion that we will get a soft landing with no recession, with the important proviso that the Fed pauses its rate-hiking cycle, which it has already done.Remarkably, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates high enough to reverse the inflation rate, at one point at a 40-year high, without causing a severe downturn. And its done it in an extremely short amount of time.The key questions now are: When does the Fed cut rates, and as importantly, why would it cut rates? If the Fed drops interest rates, what will it mean for precious metals?Fortunately, weve already had a dry run that gave us an answer to the last question.Many investors in December placed a bet on bullion when they figured the Fed was planning to lower interest rates in 2024. Spot gold hit a new record-high $2,135 an ounce on Dec. 3.Weve seen how sensitive the market is to monetary policy.Just the suggestion of coming rate cuts pushed gold to lofty heights. The Feds messaging also caused bond yields and the dollar to fall. The benchmark
10-year Treasury
slipped from 5% in November to 3.9% around Christmas-time. The
US Dollar Index
DXY dropped from 106.88 on Nov. 23 to 101.71, a reduction of 5%.It turns out golds record-high was only temporary. Within a week, it fell under $2,000.Meanwhile, the markets reaction to statements that the Fed is not going to pivot as early as everyone thought (as early as March) strengthened the dollar and bond yields. In fact it is surprising to see gold trading mostly above $2,000 so far this year, since the precious metal usually moves in the opposite direction as these two variables.I personally believe the Fed
will
cut interest rates, but not until it sees some deterioration in the jobs market and particularly, a drop-off in consumer spending. Im sticking to my prediction of three quarter-point rate cut in 2024, which would take the federal funds rate from 5.5% down to 4.75%.Now to the first two questions: When will the Fed cut rates and why? (or why not?)Lets start with the observation that the US consumer makes up 70% of the economy (consumers also represent 70% of the global economy), so the Federal Reserve monitors consumer spending closely to see whether it is rising or falling.Of course the Fed is also concerned about the health of the economy  measured mostly by the stock market  and its twin mandates of keeping inflation within its 2% target, and the economy near full employment.On Friday, Jan. 26, the release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index strengthened the argument that the Fed will reduce rates later this year. Core PCE (i.e., stripping out food and energy) is the Feds preferred inflation gauge.On a six-month annualized basis, core PCE was below the Feds 2% target in December for a second straight month, at 1.9%. On an annualized basis core PCE was 2.9%. Even if we take the latter figure, inflation appears to be coming down to the Feds 2% target.So, with inflation pretty much beaten, does that mean its time to cut interest rates? A week ago, the analysts seemed to think so.Evidence continues to pile up that the Fed has met its inflation goal, which will make it harder for officials to hold off on cutting rates until midyear, Bloomberg quoted an economist with LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics.The stage is set for the Fed to take steps toward cutting rates and tapering the pace of Quantitative Tightening (QT) in coming months. We expect the Fed to begin lowering the federal funds rate target range in March as it attempts to stick a soft landing, Bloomberg Economics agreed.When the Federal Open Market Committee had its regular meeting this past Tuesday-Wednesday, it voted for the fourth consecutive meeting to leave interest rates alone, at 5.25-5.5%. CNN reported the Fed made a statement indicating it was done raising interest rates, by removing language that suggested a willingness to keep raising rates until inflation was under control, i.e., nearing 2%.But hold on. The Fed also made clear it is not ready to start cutting, and particularly will not lower rates in March, as previously expected.Fresh economic data out Friday, Feb. 2, provided more information for Fed watchers like me to digest.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the economy added 353,000 jobs in January, and 333,000 in December. Most industries gained positions last month, with the exception of mining and
natural gas
extraction. The numbers doubled consensus forecasts of 176,500 new jobs.More good news: unemployment remained at 3.7%, and wages grew 0.6% for the month and 4.5% year over year. CNN said its the 24
th
consecutive month that the US jobless rate has been under 4%.The fact that the unemployment rate has been below 4% for 24 months straight for the first time since 1967 is truly remarkable, Joe Brusuelas, chief economist and principal at RSM US, told CNN Business.This despite the fact that the Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates 11 times since March, 2022. Were talking about the biggest and fastest increase in interest rates in a generation.Indeed the economy appears to be firing on all cylinders  defying expectations that the Feds tight monetary policy would crash the economy and lead to a recession.CNN notes that
Januarys job gains dashed market expectations for a Fed rate cut to come sooner than later, perhaps as early as March, and for the central bank to cut as many as six times in 2024. Investors probability for a March rate cut dropped from 38% to under 20% on Friday, according to the
CME FedWatch Tool
.Far from collapsing, the US economy grew 2.5% in 2023, up from 1.9% in 2022. Fourth-quarter GDP was even better, at 3.3%.The Associated Press notes that consumers drove growth in the final quarter of 2023, with spending expanding at an annual 2.8%, on goods like clothing, furniture and recreational vehicles, and services like hotels and restaurant meals.Fun fact:
Taylor Swifts Eras Tour is expected to generate close to $5 billion
in the United States alone.If Taylor Swift were an economy, shed be bigger than 50 countries, said Dan Fleetwood, president of QuestionPro Research and Insights, in a Time Magazine story.Many saw Swift watching the Kansas City Chiefs last weekend in the NFL Conference Championship game. According to the New York Post,Taylor Swift has helped direct big bucks toward the NFL  with
16% of US shoppers admitting the pop star influenced them to spend cash on football
in the walkup to Super Bowl LVIII, according to a recent survey.The numbers mean that of 333.3 million Americans, according to the latest census data, some 53 million have spent money on the sport since
Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce first went public
with their romance.Most shelled out cash for jerseys and memorabilia or on a streaming service subscription to watch NFL games, according to a
study on credit card spending
by online financial firm LendingTree on Monday.Retail investors are seemingly off the sidelines, with US stock markets reaching new heights on an almost daily basis. The
S&P 500
registered an all-time closing high of 4,958.61 points Friday, as tech stocks soared and investors digested the positive employment report. Reuters said all three major US stock indexes notched their fourth consecutive weekly gains.Manufacturing is up too: the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said Thursday that its January manufacturing PMI increased to 49.1, compared to 47.1 in December.What does the strong economy mean for monetary policy? Well, the January BLS report indicates the job market is strong, wages are rising, and this was reflected in a record-high stock market close. I previously said there was a 50-50 chance of the Fed cutting rates by a quarter-point in March, but these latest numbers, imo, put that chance at zero.Why cut rates when the economy is booming? If we think of each interest rate percentage as a bullet, the Fed has 5.5 bullets in the chamber. Why fire one off needlessly? In hiking rates 11 times in the past nearly two years, the organization has given itself ample room to maneuver. If it only cuts rates by a quarter-point each time, thats 22 opportunities to lower rates to 0%  which is where we ended up when the Fed aggressively cut interest rates following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.It seems we have come full circle  we are now back above 5%, where the federal funds rate was in mid-2007, just before the 2008 financial crisis which started the now-familiar quantitative easing policy of slashing interest rates and injecting liquidity into the financial system through the Feds purchase of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities.(Some think we could have elevated rates for a while. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers on Friday warned of +3% yields on US Treasury bills through to 2030.)In 2008, the US consumer had stopped spending, and the Fed needed to change that. It did it through QE/ money-printing, and dramatically lowering interest rates.The same thing happened when the pandemic hit. The sudden drop in consumer spending panicked the Fed, which went on another QE bender, only this time, the government got involved by sending direct stimulus checks to Americans. Corporations received covid relief too.Not only that, but the Fed dropped interest rates to 0-0.25%, goosing the economy by making borrowed money practically free.These things go in cycles and its only a matter of time before the wheel turns again, back to lower rates.Right now, the Fed needs to see inflation stabilizing. They want to see a sustained period of cooling inflation below their 2% target before lowering borrowing costs.To me, this means a minimum of five months of continued lower inflation.Ill stay with my original projection of three quarter-point rate reductions this year. These are token cuts that could be political in nature. Remember, this is an election year and the Fed, despite its claimed independence, has been known to take sides. The New York Times recently wrote,The Fed may have already, and unintentionally, helped Mr. Bidens re-election prospects by holding rates steady for the back half of 2023 as inflation cooled. Continued rate increases could have slammed the breaks on economic activity and increased the chances that the economy slipped into recession  which is one reason progressive groups, and some Democratic senators, urged Fed officials to pause rate increases last year.Of course there are other, more practical reasons for lowering interest rates, the 
US
public debt-to-GDP ratio
is at 94% and rising by more than 5% per year, enough to double the ratio within 13 years,
and the national debt now sitting at a jaw-dropping $34 trillion. Interest costshave nearly doubledover the past three years, from $345 billion in 2020 to $659 billion in 2023.Its hard to say when a rate cut is coming (9 out of 10 economists predict April 30
th
/May 1
st
meeting); there is certainly no hurry. As far as the Fed is concerned, everything is coming up roses. Why rock the boat?But when a rate cut
does
come, and AOTH agrees the April/May meeting is likely for the first quarter-point cut, the decision will, imo, be driven by the spending habits of US consumers, which remember, make up 70% of the economy. Signals could include reduced consumer spending, credit card debt, loan and mortgage delinquencies, a higher savings rate, and wage deflation. The Fed will also of course, be watching unemployment numbers closely.In the meantime, Im positioning myself for the coming interest rate cuts, and the subsequent weakening of the US dollar, by purchasing the shares of junior gold and silver companies, which offer great leverage to rising metal prices."
Investing.com,Dollar and equities rip higher after stellar US jobs data,2024-02-05,0.444444,
Investing.com,Gold Falls as US Dollar Rises; EUR/USD Drops to a 7-Week Low,2024-02-05,0.555556,"The gold (XAU) price dropped by 0.79% on Friday after better-than-expected US Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report figures.The
US Dollar Index
(DXY) and Treasury yields rocketed following a robust US NFP report, further decreasing chances for a rate hike by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in the near future. The report revealed 353,000 jobs created in January, greatly surpassing the forecast of 180,000. Robust job growth, fueled by a resilient economy and strong worker productivity, could bolster businesses to continue hiring and retaining staff, potentially safeguarding the economy from a recession this year. Despite a minor decline of less than 1% following the report, gold is 'holding on like a barnacle despite a whopper of an employment report,' noted Tai Wong, an independent metals analyst based in New York. 'But we might need to wait a little and see if gold grinds much lower,' he added. Market sentiment shifted after the release: the CME Fed Watch Tool now indicates that traders see a 70% chance of the rate cut in May, decreasing from 92% before the NFP data. Overall, high-interest rates decrease the attractiveness of non-yielding assets like bullion.XAU/USD
was declining during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders should focus on the US ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 3:00 p.m. UTC. Strong figures may pull XAU/USD towards 2,020 again. However, the short-term bearish trend in XAU/USD might reverse if the numbers are lower than expected. 'Spot gold may retest support at $2,028 per ounce, with a good chance of breaking below it and falling into a $2,010$2,019 range,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.The euro (EUR) lost 0.81% on Friday after a much better-than-expected US Employment Situation report, showing a strong rise in nonfarm payrolls and robust growth in average hourly earnings.The upbeat US employment report has reduced the chances of near-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), boosting the US dollar and Treasury yields.
EUR/USD
now trades at a 7-week low, near a critical 1.07500 level, as investors' interest rate expectations have shifted dramatically. Friday's data has not only altered investors' short-term interest rate expectations but also changed their long-term outlook. According to the latest interest rate swap market data, investors now price in less than 120 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the Fed but more than 130 bps cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) by the end of 2024. The market now anticipates the ECB to be more dovish than the Fed, which is exerting downward pressure on the euro.EUR/USD continued falling during the Asian session but started to recover in the early European trading hours. Today, two events might provoke extra volatility in all USD pairs: the US ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 3:00 p.m. UTC and Raphael Bostic's speech at 7:00 p.m. UTC. The ISM Services PMI report is more important and will likely produce an immediate market response. At the same time, Bostic's remarks may lack new details, so the market's reaction could be insignificant. If PMI figures are better than expected, the bearish trend in EUR/USD will likely continue, potentially dropping the pair below 1.07500. Conversely, EUR/USD may correct upwards if the numbers are below expectations.The Japanese yen (JPY) plunged by 1.31% on Friday, losing all the gains it had made since 24 January.Investors have decreased their expectations for aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) this year after the US Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report underpinned a still resilient US economy. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut in May is now less than 60%. At the same time, investors expect the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to start raising rates only in June. Thus, the relative divergence between the US and Japan's monetary policies continues to favor the
US dollar
.Still, some analysts expect the BOJ to begin monetary policy tightening sooner. For example, Societe Generale analysts believe the regulator will raise interest rates and abolish its yield curve control policy in March, as they view the last monetary policy statement as hawkish.Kenzaki sees the BOJ raising rates towards 0% in March but thinks the bank will likely declare that it will support its 0% interest rate and quantitative easing policies until it has confidence in the stable realization of its 2% inflation target.USD/JPY
was rising in the Asian session but then started to decline during the early European trading session. The relative monetary policy is the most important driver of USD/JPY's exchange rate, so any macroeconomic data that shifts interest rate expectations will immediately impact the pair. Therefore, today's US ISM Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 3:00 p.m. UTC may cause extra volatility. Better-than-expected figures might push USD/JPY above 149.000. However, if PMI figures disappoint investors, USD/JPY may drop towards 147.700."
Investing.com,US Dollar Explodes as Fed Bets Change,2024-02-05,0.555556,"Fridays abnormally strong jobs data resonated like a bomb across the financial markets. The US economy added 353000 nonfarm jobs last month versus the consensus of around 185000 new job additions. The average wage growth unexpectedly accelerated to 4.5%, and the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%. Here we are, finding ourselves with an NFP number above 350000 just a few weeks before the Federal Reserve (Fed) will presumably start cutting interest rates. The jobs numbers are looking great  to say the least, and the US economic growth continues to surprise to the upside. None of these numbers point to recession, or a need for the Fed to start cutting the rates. The only possible pain is the resurfacing of regional bank's worries. But besides that, nothing suggests that the Fed should be cutting the rates in March, or even in May.As such, a March rate cut from the Fed looks like a pipe dream. Activity on Fed funds futures now gives less than 20% chance for a rate cut to happen in March. Remember, this probability stood at around 80% at the start of the year. And the probability of a May cut has fallen to around 70%, whereas the market was pricing a May cut near almost 100% before the jobs data.The dramatic jobs number on Friday met a dramatic reaction from the bond markets. The
US 2-year yield
which best captures the Fed rate bets jumped more than 20bp, the
10-year yield
jumped past 4%, and the
US Dollar Index
rallied past its 200-DMA and reached the highest levels since early December. The
EUR/USD
slipped below the 1.08 level on a broad-based rally in the
US dollar
on Friday and hit my 100-DMA bearish target. Strengthening trend and momentum indicators, and a reasonable RSI index suggests that the euro selloff could extend. Next bearish target stands at 1.0710, the major 61.8% Fibonacci retracement on October to December rally. The
USD/JPY
 which had started to have a taste of the 145s last week is back above 148, and Cable is back testing the 1.26 to the downside.As we dont have life changing data, the market will continue to digest the strong US jobs data. The latter could help the US dollar consolidate and extend gains. The most important events on this weeks economic calendar are the Chinese inflation numbers and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rate decision. Deflation in China is expected to have accelerated and the RBA is expected to keep its rates unchanged. The
AUD/USD
slipped below its 100-DMA and is testing the 65 cents support to the downside this morning. Chinas inability to boost appetite, retreat in iron ore prices and now this strong US dollar should continue to weigh on the Aussie.Interestingly  and happily, the jump in the US yields and the severe retreat in Fed rate cut bets didnt impact the stock markets AT ALL. Stock traders were in such a great mood on Friday that the good jobs data was almost welcome as a sign of strong economic growth and good future earnings. Meta (NASDAQ:
META
) jumped 20% to a fresh all-time high, gained more than $200bn in market value in just one trading session - the biggest one-day gain in the history of one-day gains. Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) jumped nearly 8% and is finally back to its long-term ascending trend. Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) hit a fresh record because  why not! And the
S&P 500
closed at a fresh record.The funny thing is that about half of S&P 500s early year gains are due to Magnificent 7 stocks. The equal weight index has been completely flat. And with most of Big Tech earnings out of the way without much disappointment  on the contrary, there is nothing to worry about for the overall trend for the Big Tech. Whatever happens to Fed expectations, there is something good to trade. Bad economic news means sooner and faster Fed cuts. Good economic news means better corporate profits. What can go wrong?The barrel of
US crude
fell to $72pb level last week and is not much higher this morning despite the US retaliation for last weekends attacks. The risk of escalation with Iran remains, but that risk is not being properly priced in. Trend and momentum indicators suggest that there is room for further slide. Any price rallies could be interesting tactical shorts targeting the $70pb level."

Plus, Friday was an inside day to Thursdays range.The calendar range tells us that IWM can go either way. Below the January lows spells trouble, above the highs very bullish.The Leadership has a story to tell in that it is well underperforming the SPY, which we know is unsustainable. Either SPY begins to fall or IWM must play some catch up.Momentum or Real Motion tells us that there is no real diversion between momentum and price. We can say, IWM is lying in wait.Granny Retail XRT looks better.On a monthly chart, this year was banner for XRT in that it took out a 23-month moving average or went into an expansion period.Since December, January and so far in very early February, XRT is having 2 inside months to Decembers large range.So if we step back, a move over 72.94 should be the start of something much bigger.In the meantime, the January calendar range high remains elusive, while XRT holds well above the January calendar range low.XRT also underperforms SPY. And momentum, like IWMs, lies in wait, looking ok, but not showing any divergence to price.If normalization is reached in that inflation and fed fund rates remain aligned and the public gets used to a historically viable interest rate of 5.5%, the answer is that adaptive investors will find great opportunities."

XAU/USD
essentially ended. Gold continued to weaken on Monday as the probability of the rate reduction further decreased following the release of the better-than-expected ISM Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). Furthermore, Neel Kashkari, the President of the Minneapolis Fed, said a resilient US economy means the central bank can take time before deciding to cut interest rates. Overall, investors continue to lose faith that the Fed will ease its monetary policy soon. However, Jim Wyckoff, a senior analyst at Kitco Metals, believes that 'gold should hold above the $2,000 level due to geopolitical uncertainties in the market that could quickly prompt some safe-haven demand.'XAU/USD stabilized in the Asian session and attempted to recover during the early European session. Today, the macroeconomic calendar has no major data releases, so volatility may decline and established short-term trends may continue. Still, investors should focus on changes in the tone of Fed speakers today for any clues on the timing of rate cuts. Loretta J. Mester, the President of the Cleveland Fed, will give a speech at 5:00 p.m. UTC, and the speech of Susan Collins, the President of the Boston Fed, is scheduled at 7:00 p.m. UTC.

US Dollar Index
rose after a better-than-expected US ISM Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) report.On Monday, the US dollar soared to a nearly 3-month high as market participants decreased their expectations of substantial rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) this year due to recent upbeat economic data. The growth of the US services sector accelerated in January, driven by a rise in new orders and a recovery in employment, according to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). The data indicates that the economic momentum from Q4 has carried over into 2024. 'The question is, who can keep up with the US in terms of the rates adjustment?' asked Steven Englander, a head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered Bank. 'The market's answer so far is not too many central banks and not too many of their currencies,' he added. US Treasury yields began to increase early Monday, following comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who suggested that the US central bank might 'give it some time' before opting for rate cuts. The yields climbed even higher after the release of the ISM survey results.The eurozone exhibited subtle recovery signs at the year's start: the ISM survey highlighted escalating inflation pressures, supporting the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision to maintain high-interest rates. HCOB's composite PMI slightly improved in January but still indicated economic contraction. Overall, the fundamental pressure on
EUR/USD
remains bearish as the market expects more rate cuts from the ECB than from the Fed. According to the latest interest rate swap market data, traders are currently pricing in almost 130 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the ECB and less than 120 bps by the Fed in 2024.Today, EUR/USD rose slightly in the Asian and early European trading sessions. Traders await the eurozone Retail Sales report at 10:00 a.m. UTC. Higher-than-expected figures may strengthen the euro. However, lower than the forecast numbers will put downward pressure on EUR/USD.The British pound (GBP) lost 0.78% on Monday as expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) won't cut the rates aggressively this year pushed theUS Dollar Index towards a 3-month high.Data on Monday showed that the US services sector grew in January as new orders increased and employment rebounded. Solid US economic data has disappointed traders who hoped for early and steep interest rate cuts by the Fed. At the same time, Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, and other policymakers have also highlighted the risk of premature rate cuts. As a result, investors price in only a 17% chance of the rate cut in March, compared to a 69% chance at the beginning of the year. Also, the Fed is now expecting only 120 basis points (bps) worth of cuts this year, compared to around 150 bps anticipated in early January. 'There may still be a bit of room to scale back (more), but it's likely limited given that the disinflation trend in the US is becoming more entrenched and that labor market tightness is gradually easing,' said Christopher Wong, a currency strategist at OCBC in Singapore.Meanwhile, the Bank of England's (BOE) sentiment is slowly turning dovish. Huw Pill, the BOE Chief Economist, said yesterday that the question for policymakers was 'not if but when it would be appropriate to begin to cut interest rates.' The market currently expects the central bank to start decreasing the base rate in June and is pricing in roughly 80 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts this year.GBP/USD
was rising slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The macroeconomic calendar is uneventful today, so volatility may decline and established short-term trends may continue. Still, investors should focus on Fed officials' speeches at 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. UTC.

Investing.com,US Bond Selloff Continues Amid Hawkish Fed Comments,2024-02-06,0.333333,"The selloff in US bonds extended to a second day on the back of crowded hawkish comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) members and on the surprising strength of the US economy. The latest ISM data printed yesterday showed that US services grew at their biggest pace in four months, screaming that the US economy is too resilient and too healthy for the Fed to start cutting the rates in a hurry. As such, the US 2-year yield approached the 4.50% level and the
10-year yield
flirted with 4.18. The US sovereign bonds were better bid in Asia today, the US 10-year paper is expected to see a limited upside potential above 4.20%, but a March rate cut is off the table, and activity on fed funds futures gives no more than a two-thirds chance for a May cut  which remains quite high and could be further curbed.Naturally, the
US dollar
extended its rally above the 100-DMA and is roaring against all majors since Fridays jobs data. But note that the other central bankers wont sit quietly, turning their thumbs, faced with the rate cut bets. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) for example kept its policy rate unchanged at todays meeting and warned that a further monetary policy TIGHTENING cannot be ruled out if needed. The
AUD/USD
found buyers below 65 cents.The OECD also warned central bankers that its certainly too early to declare victory on inflation because growth remains resilient. According to their latest forecasts, global economic growth will slow to 2.9% this year, from 3.1% last year. Its above their November forecast, but not all locations have the same bright outlook: the US forecast has been revised higher by 0.6 percentage point, while the euro area economic outlook is downed by 0.3 percentage points. The euro areas economic divergence is due to its higher vulnerability to higher rates and the energy crisis  as duh, Europe has no fossil energy and cant pump like crazy as the US does. And all that sums up to the same conclusion that I have been trying to convey since weeks: the Fed is in a better position to keep rates steady than the ECB. And that divergence should translate into a softer euro against the dollar. The
EUR/USD
fell to 1.0723 yesterday as the soaring US yields and the stronger dollar hit all majors across the board. We could see the euros selloff slow after a big two-day slide, but the euro outlook remains bearish as the economic data on this side of the Atlantic doesnt look as encouraging as on the US coast and it would only make sense if the ECB started cutting the rates before the Fed, which would imply a further euro weakness.In equities, the extension of yesterdays selloff weighed on major US indices, but not too much. The
S&P500
retreated by a meager 0.32% from an ATH, as MAMAA stocks eked out a small gain while Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) gained another near 5% because Goldman Sachs upped its price target to $800 per share. Nvidia traded at the doorstep of $700 per share yesterday, another $100 rise is peanuts at the current momentum. There wont be much to stop investors from buying  other than crazy valuations and deeply overbought conditions  before the February 21st earnings. The question is not whether Nvidia could rise to $800. It is whether it could consolidate gains after the results.Buying Chinese equities feels like catching a falling knife. The Chinese stock markets are in a better shape this morning as authorities came up with fresh measures to stop the bleeding in Chinese stock markets. This time, China announced trade restrictions on domestic institutional investors and some offshore units, and imposed caps on some cross-border swaps that could be used to short Hong Kong stocks. They also told some brokers not to reduce their exposure to mainland shares
.
But all these measures are essentially attempting to turn the mill with carried water
 they have been inefficient to trigger a sustained recovery and they will hardly bring investors back on board. The major worry is the Xi-led governments radical change of mindset, which involves severe government crackdowns on the former investor gems like Alibaba (NYSE:
BABA
) and Tencent and the destruction of the Chinese dream. Throwing money into the mix is a clumsy quick fix, it wont fix confidence."
Investing.com,A Bank Crisis Is Percolating,2024-02-06,0.222222,"I didnt watch Jay Powell on 60 Minutes because I knew it would be mainstream media sugar-coated drivel wrapped around propaganda as the obsequious 60 Minutes anchor tossed J-Pow meatball questions. But I did learn that Powell asserted that it is unlikely that there will be another real estate-led bank crisis, particularly with the TBTF banks. I course, theres no way he can honestly say that he has a clue as to the potential magnitude of CRE exposure via OTC derivatives at the TBTFs  no one does. And Powells statement is certainly reminiscent of when Ben Bernanke asserted that the subprime debt problem was contained in 2007Note: The FOMC removed the sentence The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient from the FOMC Policy Statement released Wednesday. Read into that what you want but if the Fed was unwilling to make that assertion, its likely that the bank crisis from early 2023 is rearing its ugly head again. Note that the Fed stabilized the banking system back then by promptly printing money to inject $400 billion in reserves in the banking system. It also set-up the Bank Term Funding Program without a ceiling, which had $167.7 billion drawn from it as of January 25th.The Fed also announced that it was cutting off the funding from BTFP in March and it is drawing up a plan to encourage banks to use the Fed Discount Window for liquidity needs. The Discount Window is perceived as a last resort lending facility and a signal that the borrower is in financial trouble. Banks borrow overnight and pledge high-quality fixed-income collateral like Treasuries, agency securities, etc.Possible trigger for a big stock market sell-off? Ironically, a week after the Fed announced that it would stop making new BTFP loans on March 11th as scheduled, $168 billion in deposits flowed out of the banks. Its the biggest weekly drop since the SVB crisis. Theres thus a good possibility that the continuation of the 2023 regional bank crisis may be percolating. KRE, the regional bank ETF was down 7.2% for the week.The stock price of New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:
NYCB
) plunged 37.6% on Wednesday (January 31st) after it reported a surprise loss for Q4 and cut its dividend. The stock was down another 13.8% the next day. Its down 56% since the end of July.NYCB closed the acquisition of Flagstar Bank in Q1, which diversified the banks loan business into residential mortgages and the servicing of residential mortgages. It also acquired Signature Banks commercial and industrial loan portfolio deposits. Prior to these acquisitions, NYCB was primarily a multi-family CRE lender.Multi-family housing mortgages represent 44.5% of NYCBs loan portfolio. Commercial real estate and commercial property acquisition, development, and construction represent 15.9% of NYCBs loan portfolio. CRE loans in total represent 60% of the banks loans. Total interest income declined 4.3% from Q3. The YoY comparison is not relevant because of the two acquisitions mentioned above. The source of the loss in Q4 was a $552 million provision for loan losses. The reason for the provision is the expectation of write-downs in its CRE portfolio, particularly the office sector. In addition, a portion of the credit loss provision is to reflect, as the banks states it, potential repricing risk in the multi-family portfolio. Thats a polished way to warn that it expects write-downs in its multi-family loan holdings.For the full year, NYCB reported $2.341 billion in GAAP net income  but theres a catch. In Q1 the bank recognized a bargain purchase gain (non-cash) of $2.150 billion, representing the difference between what it paid for Signature Banks assets and the guesstimated fair market value of the assets. Part of the loan loss provision is a partial reversal of that gain. Removing that non-cash bump in income, NYCBs net income for the full year was just $191 million, down from $650 million (70%) in 2022. So far the acquisitions have been failures.The bank charged off (net of recoveries) $223 million in loans in 2023. Of that, $119 million was multi-family and $117 million of that was in Q4. The bank also reported $442 billion in non-performing loans at the end of 2023, $266 million of which were multi-family/CRE and another $95 million were residential mortgages. The magnitude of the provision tells us that the bank expects to write-off quite a bit more multi-family and office debt as well as residential mortgages. In addition, the bank classified another $250 million in loans as 30 to 89 days past due.In my opinion, this downward spiral in NYCBs loan portfolio is just getting started. The quality of NYCBs total loan portfolio will continue to decline. The $83.6 billion in loan assets is financed with $81.3 billion in checking/money market deposits, savings deposits, and CDs. It also has $20.2 billion in wholesale borrowings, which are loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank. This source jumped from $13 billion at the end of Q3 to $20.2 billion at the end of Q4. Recall that bank loans from the FHLB spiked higher just prior to the regional bank crisis in March 2023. I cant say for certain, but its possible the jump in FHLB loans from Q3 is an indicator of financial stress.A good, cheap way to bet on the demise of NYCB is with January 2025 or 2026 $3 puts. But it may take a while for NYCB to grind lower, particularly if the Fed aggressively cuts rates later this year. But I wanted to discuss what happened to NYCB because Japans Aozora Bank ADRs plunged 26.1% Thursday after slashing the value of some of its U.S. office tower loans by more than 50%.Aozora is Japans 16th largest bank by market value and said it would post a $191 million loss for the fiscal year vs previous guidance of $164 million in profits. The banks biggest US office loan exposure is Chicago and Los Angeles and it disclosed that it has $719 million in non-performing loans in the U.S. It increased its loan-loss reserve ratio on U.S. offices to 18.8% from 9.1%.While everyone was discussing the potential for a CRE debt crisis to foment this year, the NYCB and Aozora earnings reports confirm that it has already begun. $117 billion in CRE office debt needs to be refinanced this year, led by buildings in NYC ($10 billion), SF (nearly $4 billion), Chicago (over $2 billion) and LA ($2 billion).The problem is that many buildings in these cities are worth, based on recent market transactions, 50% or less of their book values. Blackstone (NYSE:
BX
) is marketing a Manhattan tower with a $308 million mortgage for $150 million. Thats the offer price. The building, if it sells, will sell for a lower valuation. The loan-to-value on many buildings is 100% to 200%. The vacancy rate of offices in NY, SF, Chicago and LA is near 20%. An article in the Denver Post last week reported that the vacancy rate in downtown Denver is 37%. If these loans can not be refinanced, they will need to be severely restructured or put in bankruptcy for liquidation. This will blow holes in regional bank balance sheets and REIT NAVs. It could well also blow big holes in the TBTF bank balance sheets via OTC derivatives exposure."

Investing.com,Gold Rises as US Dollar Drops; EUR/USD Rises Above 1.07500,2024-02-07,0.666667,"Gold (XAU) increased by 0.53% on Tuesday as the
US dollar
and Treasury yields retreated.Unexpectedly robust US employment and services sector data and Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments have decreased the likelihood of interest rate reductions. As a result, the
US Dollar Index
continues to move near multi-month highs even after yesterday's minor pullback. In a recent interview, Powell echoed his previous statement, suggesting that a rate cut in March is unlikely. He also mentioned that the central bank plans to proceed with rate cuts more gradually than the market predicts.XAU/USD
was essentially unchanged in Asian and early European trading sessions. There are no major data releases today, but Fed officials' speeches might clarify future US monetary policy. If speeches support Jerome Powell's rather hawkish stance, XAU/USD may decline towards 2,024. Otherwise, gold may strengthen. 'Spot gold may retrace to $2,029 per ounce as it failed to break resistance at $2,038,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.The euro (EUR) gained 0.12% on Tuesday as the US Dollar Index (DXY) corrected after a strong 2-day rally.Still,
EUR/USD
continues to trade near multi-month lows as strong US macroeconomic data and hawkish comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) officials bolster the US dollar. Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Fed, said she couldn't provide the exact timing of rate cuts amid ongoing inflation uncertainty. Thus, the market's expectations for an interest rate cut in May continue to slide. Now, investors price in only a 54% chance of a 25 basis point rate reduction in May. At the same time, the likelihood of a rate cut in the eurozone is also decreasing. Boris Vujcic, Croatia's central bank governor, told Reuters that the European Central Bank (ECB) doesn't need to rush cutting rates, arguing that the 'equilibrium' rate in Europe is higher than it used to be.EUR/USD was rising slightly in the Asian and European trading sessions. The macroeconomic calendar is uneventful today, so the pair will likely move within the established trend. However, the upcoming speeches by Fed officials could shed some light on the future path of US interest rates and spur some volatility in all USD pairs. Adriana Kugler and Michelle Bowman, members of the Fed Board of Governors, and Tom Barkin, the president of Richmond Fed, will have speeches at 4:00 p.m., 7:00 p.m., and 5:30 p.m. UTC. If they give hawkish messages, the bearish trend in EUR/USD might resume, potentially taking the pair below the important 1.07000 level. Meanwhile, a dovish message may trigger a short-term rally towards 1.08000.Despite dropping below 0.65000 against the US dollar, the Australian dollar (AUD) recovered and gained 0.63% on Tuesday.As expected, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept its base interest rate unchanged on Tuesday. However, the regulator said a further increase is possible, given that inflation is still too high. Australia's cash rate has remained steady at a 12-year high of 4.35% since November 2023.According to the interest rate swap market data, investors consider the RBA one of the least dovish central banks among the G7 countries. The market expects only around 50 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts in 2024. Thus,
AUD/USD
may continue rising, potentially targeting a 0.67000 area.AUD/USD was rising slightly in the Asian and European trading sessions. Today, the macroeconomic calendar is light, so the pair's short-term bullish trend may continue. However, traders should be careful as the upcoming speeches by Fed officials could give more details on the path of US interest rates and spur some volatility in USD pairs. Adriana Kugler and Michelle Bowman, members of the Fed Board of Governors, and Tom Barkin, the president of Richmond Fed, will have speeches at 4:00 p.m., 7:00 p.m., and 5:30 p.m. UTC, respectively. Hawkish messages may resume the bearish trend in AUD/USD, potentially taking the pair below the important 0.65000 level. Otherwise, the pair may face a short-term rally towards 0.66000."
Investing.com,Second Inflation Wave? Why 2020s Arent the 1970s by Any Stretch of Imagination,2024-02-07,0.333333,"We wrote this four-part inflation series in response to the graph below, implying that prices are on the same inflation roller coaster ride as the 1970s.If you have read the first three parts of this series
(ONE
,
TWO
, and
THREE
), you have a better appreciation for some similarities and differences between inflation of the last few years and that of the 1970s. With that wisdom, we share our opinion.We always conclude articles with a summary. Given the gravity of inflation on investment returns, we think it is worth starting with our opinion and then providing details to support it.We strongly believe the recent inflation outbreak was overwhelmingly the result of the pandemic and the governmental, Fed, corporate, and personal reactions to it.
The virus and its economic effects were felt around the world, making matters even more impactful,Unprecedented fiscal and monetary actions amplified the demand for goods and services well beyond norms.At the same time, the production of many goods was severely limited, and transportation lines were broken. Consequently, the supply of most goods and many services was severely constrained, and at the same time, demand was recovering rapidly.Given such unique events, and barring an unforeseen calamity like the pandemic, another inflation surge is not likely.The multiple bouts of inflation in the 1970s were not the result of one exceptional incident but many bad decisions.Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and government repeatedly, and unbeknownst to them, employed policies that increased prices for fifteen years.The Fed has learned many lessons since then, which instills confidence in our opinion. However, the government has little regard for them, which does pose a threat to our opinion.As the pandemic-related stimulus slowly but surely exits the financial system and the economy and the supply lines fully heal, inflation will continue to fall back to or below the pre-pandemic average.That said, the odds of another round of higher inflation are not zero, as we will elaborate.Before we start, it is worth reviewing a few snippets from That 70s Show, an article we wrote last December. The article discusses the economic environment of the 1970s and how it differs from todays.The first quote and graphs below show how the debt burden has changed over the last fifty years.Next, the mix of what the nation produces and consumes has reversed.The Fed has often admitted it played a significant role in generating multiple waves of inflation in the 1970s. At the time, low unemployment was the primary goal.Such was a lingering relic from the Great Depression. Higher inflation in the name of lower unemployment was acceptable.Furthermore, the Fed did not appreciate the potential for a price-wage spiral or changes in consumption patterns due to inflation and how they could affect employment.The Feds tragic errors from the 1970s appear to haunt them today and provide instructive guidance.In August 2021, Jerome Powell stressed evidence that consumer behaviors change with inflation. Per Powell:In February 2023, Powell made the following statement, assuring the public that the Fed was aware of the potential for a price wage spiral.Even of greater significance, the Fed now realizes that the money supply is a crucial inflation component. However, equally important is money velocity, or the rate at which money is spent. The combination creates inflation or deflation.The Fed is to fault for inflation. They allowed the money supply to proliferate as they kept doing QE and targeting a zero Fed Funds rate despite the velocity of money rebounding rapidly.The graph below shows how the money supply quickly grew while velocity accelerated and inflation ensued.However, starting in 2022, the Fed turned extremely hawkish. Not only did they raise the Fed Funds rate to over 5% in two years, but they initiated QT. The result of their actions was not only to slow the growth of the money supply but also to cause it to contract.The graph below lines up the money supply from 1966 to 1982 with our recent period. In the 1970s, the Fed never allowed the money supply to shrink. They were singularly focused on the Fed Funds rate.The lesson learned from that day was that managing the money supply is a much more impactful tool on prices and economic activity than adjusting the Fed Funds rate.The last time the money supply contracted, as it is now, was during the Great Depression and World War 2.The Fed and Jerome Powell were willing to endure a recession and higher unemployment to bring inflation back to its target. CBS News titled an article, 
The Fed Plans To Sharply Boost Unemployment
.
In it, Powell is quoted regarding unemployment: 
I wish there were a painless way to do that, Powell said. There isnt.Fed President Susan Collins offered, 
I do anticipate that accomplishing price stability will require slower employment growth and a somewhat higher unemployment rate.Unlike the Fed, the federal government did not learn its lessons from the 1970s.After the economy was well on its way to recovery, their reckless spending pushed the money supply higher than it would have been and created a tailwind for inflation.Recent deficits are well below those witnessed in 2020 and 2021 but are abnormally large, given such a robust economy.In the fiscal year 2023, the federal deficit was 5.7 percent of GDP. This year, the CBO estimates it will increase to 6.8 percent of GDP.The graph below shows the only other times the deficit, as a percentage of GDP, has been higher than today was during World War 1 and 2, the 2008 financial crisis, and a few years ago during the height of the pandemic.Those were emergencies.One of the significant factors behind recent inflation was the unprecedented global shuttering of the economy. The limited supply of goods and handicapped transportation systems grossly restricted the amount of goods on the market.While production problems still exist, they have primarily normalized. In the 1970s, the government unknowingly incentivized goods shortages via wage and price control measures.Lacking the ability to raise prices to reflect the increasing costs of their inputs, some companies had no choice but to limit or halt production and curtail supply.Today, the government is not taking action to stop or restrict the production or transportation of goods.The gross distortions to the supply side of the inflation equation were solely related to the pandemic and should not be forecasted to return in such an impactful way.We now run through a litany of other contributors to inflation.Our dependency on foreign oil has declined substantially, as shown below. Before 2008, the U.S. depended on imports for about half of its oil needs. Since the abundance of shale oil, we have become energy-independent.While the situations in the Middle East and Russia may escalate, an embargo like that of fifty years will be much less damaging. However, short-term price spurts can happen as oil prices are based on global factors.Throughout 2022, Jerome Powell incessantly fretted about the potential for a price wage spiral. Recent union negotiations with the automakers, Hollywood writers and actors, FedEx (NYSE:
FDX
), and other companies fueled concerns of a price wage spiral.Regarding the potential for a price wage spiral, we must consider that in the 1970s, unions carried much more bargaining power, and one out of every five workers was a union member.The graph below from Bloomberg shows that union membership has consistently decreased since. It now stands at only 10% of workers, limiting the potential for unions to drive wages higher for the entire workforce.Further new technologies, off-shoring jobs, and the ability to hire remote workers are also helping keep a lid on wages.Todays economic landscape, including debt load, demographics, and productivity growth, differs from the 1970s. The Fed projects the nations long-term economic growth rate at 1.85%. Such lines up with slowing productivity growth, as shown below.From 1960 to 1985, real GDP averaged 3.7%, more than double the current trend growth. In the 1970s, the population grew by over 1% annually. Today, that number is half a percent and is expected to decline steadily.Also, of incredible importance, debt was not a considerable headwind to growth 50 years ago. Since then, debt has grown four times faster than GDP, as shown below.Given our heavy dependence on debt and, therefore, low-interest rates, the economys ability to tolerate higher inflation is much less than in the 70s.Fiscal dominance, whereby the Fed must set monetary policy to keep the government solvent, is now necessary
.Given the economic and demographic trends noted above and the ever-increasing debt, its hard to imagine that the Fed will tolerate above-trend inflation or higher interest rates for sustained periods.Fiscally fueled demand has been a crucial driver of inflation over the past few years. However, if demand factors, as noted above, resume pre-pandemic trends, GDP will slow, and significant demand-driven price increases are not likely.Lastly, the government has a negative debt multiplier. Each dollar of debt eventually takes away from economic growth. As recent deficit spending turns from stimulus to headwinds, economic growth will continue to trend lower. With it, inflation will follow.The Treasury and Fed introduced a new recession-fighting playbook in 2020. The combination of direct checks and benefits to the public alongside grossly easy monetary policy played a significant role in fueling inflation.If that playbook becomes the rule and not an exception, we could see periods of higher-than-trend inflation. But even with such a fiscal reply to a recession, supply line problems will not be the problem they were a few years ago.Given the unlikelihood that the global economy will shut down again, higher inflation due to fiscal and monetary negligence is possible, but not at the levels we witnessed in 2021 and 2022.At its core, inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. That was the case in 2020 through 2022. This is not the case anymore.The 2020s arent the 1970s by any stretch of the imagination! While the lead graph from Apollo may show recent inflation trends align well with those of the 1970s, we think it is grossly misleading."
Investing.com,US Bond Market Fluctuations,2024-02-07,0.555556,"The selloff in US sovereign bonds reversed yesterday after solid demand for the US
3-year
bond auction counterweighed a bulk of hawkish comments from Federal Reserve (Fed) members.The Fed members are on the battlefield, fighting the doves. Loretta Mester said there is no rush to cut rates and Neel Kashkari said that the Fed hasnt reached its inflation goal yet. The game is now being played for a May cut, with around two-thirds probability attached to it.And there is one thing that keeps the doves resisting: the resurfacing US regional bank worries and a potential commercial real estate crisis. The New York Community Bank Corp plunged another 22% on Tuesday after Moodys downgraded its rating to junk. Whats encouraging is that the KBW index gave no reaction to the latest shake, as proof that the Fed has been extremely successful in isolating the banking sector woes with liquidity and stopgap measures. Whats worrying is that these measures will expire next month. But whats soothing is that the Fed could use them whenever needed to calm down the market nerves. Investors also bear in mind that the next move from the Fed is most probably the loosening of financial conditions  that should help the sector as a whole. And the sole expectation of easing Fed is enough to juice the markets mouth. This is certainly why the New York Community Bancorp's (NYSE:
NYCB
) misfortune hasnt triggered a domino effect across the banking sector, and the winds could turn around before a crisis pops in the problematic real estate sector. Thats happy news.Happy enough to push the
S&P 500 index
a little higher yesterday as one regional bank extended its weekly losses to 50%. In the bright spot was Palantir (NYSE:
PLTR
)  a data analytics company, jumped 30% after announcing AI-related revenue earlier than thought. Their commercial revenue soared by 70% compared to the same time last year as the deal flow rose to a level that no one expected before 2025.Elsewhere, Snap fell 32% in the after-hours trading after disappointing Q4 revenue, but its too small to care, and BP (NYSE:
BP
), in London, flirted with the 200-DMA after revealing higher than expected profits, and saying that it will buyback $1.75bn worth of shares each quarter in the H1, more than the $1.5bn buyback announced a quarter earlier. Worth noting: BP posted strong first results under its new CEO, giving the company a certain margin to stick to its strategy of shifting toward renewable energy sources rather than boosting investment in fossil fuel and gas (for which they are being forced by investors because there is more money in fossil fuel and gas). And if things go wrong, BP can scrap its promise to do good to the planet and go back to doing good to investor's pockets.The CSI 300 index is up for the 3rd straight session on broad-based stimulus measures and anticipation for more as Xi Jinping is being briefed on the heck is going on in the financial markets. To be true, I would love to be a fly in that room to see how officials are going to tell Xi that his radical change of mindset is responsible for the mess, and not the lack of money, or love for Chinese companies.Confidence is low and the economy is fragilized by a deepening property crisis, falling population and deflation. China is expected to post a deeper y-o-y deflation when it reveals its latest CPI figures tomorrow. The market's response may vary depending on investors' perceptions of the effectiveness of the stimulus measures. A deeper-than-expected deflation could boost the stimulus expectations and help stocks recover  in which case it could be an early sign of returning confidence. OR it would smash the latest stock market gains and leave the Chinese authorities desperate for support. Pick your side."
Investing.com,Strong Economy May Trump Rate Worries in the Long Run,2024-02-07,0.666667,"In general, markets edged up last month. US markets continued their rally at a slower pace as interest rates bounced around, which also constrained fixed-income returns. International markets were more mixed, with developed international markets roughly even and emerging markets down, primarily due to weak performance in China.The markets and the Fed. Last months mixed markets were a battle between rates, which moved above a 4 percent yield for the US Treasury
10-year
note, and the economy, which continued to do well and support corporate earnings growth expectations. Higher rates typically mean lower stock prices, and we saw a dip in the middle of last month, only to see the market bounce back as rates dropped near month-end.Looking forward, things appear more challenging. The January Fed meeting ended with Chair Powell pretty much ruling out a rate cut at the next meeting, which disappointed markets. Other Fed commentators also seemed more hawkish than markets had assumed, and rates have climbed substantially so far this month.Economic growth. That increase is not just about the Fed. Strong economic news raised the possibility that inflation wont continue to decrease. Fourth-quarter economic growth came in stronger than expected, and projections indicate that this could be the case for this quarter, too.Job growth was not only strong last month but accelerated, and both wage growth and spending increased. Rising consumer confidence should keep those trends in play, and business confidence also showed signs of improvement. Last months data showed a strong and resilient economyone that is likely to keep inflation reasonably hot and rates higher for longer.Earnings and valuations. The good news is that the strong economy is showing up in corporate earnings reports. So far, earnings growth is coming in ahead of expectations, which should be a cushion for share prices. While interest rates and valuations could be a challenge, the strong economy and earnings growth will potentially more than offset that. This means that we may have a reasonable prospect of growth.International and political risks. While overall conditions remain positive, there are still risks. Besides the Fed and interest rates, the ongoing war in the Middle East shows signs of expanding and affecting trade routes and supply lines, which could hurt inflation and growth. Domestic politics remain a concern as the election gets closer. But with the fundamentals reasonably healthy and the macro picture stabilizing, many economic fears that pulled markets back last year may be subsiding.Monitoring inflation. As we move away from the start of the year, the key issues will be how fast the economy grows and what that means for inflation. Market expectations on rates have changed rapidly but are now more aligned with reality, so the effects of the Fed are likely to be less negative going forward. That said, all of this is data-dependent, and we will need to keep an eye out.And thats the bottom line here: While conditions are good, volatility is very possible. We saw some turbulence in January, and we arent out of the woods with inflation yet. So, while the trends remain positive, risks could increase over the next couple of months. This is something to watch out for but not worry about too much, given the strong economic fundamentals."

Investing.com,Nobel Laureate Warns,2024-02-08,0.333333,"Its hardly the first time that the sharp rise in interest rates over the previous two years has prompted warnings about the business cycle outlook from an economist.Yet the forecast still resonates when it comes from a Nobel laureate, even in the wake of the latest upbeat US economic news.The biggest short-term risk is the central bank raised interest rates too far, too fast, explained Joseph Stiglitz at a conference hosted by the Japan Society in New York on Wednesday (Feb. 7).Speaking at the groups Global Risk Forum, he said the Federal Reserve misdiagnosed the spike in inflation in 2021-2022, which led to sharp increases in interest rates to tame pricing pressure.Although there are signs that the policy tightening is succeeding as a contributing factor to the recent run of disinflation with limited fallout for growth, the economics professor at Columbia University still sees the potential for trouble ahead.Stiglitz said the Fed saw inflation as a demand-side problem, but the economist told the audience it was primarily a supply-side issue.As an example, he advised that a key factor in inflations rise in the current cycle has been an increase in housing prices, which accounted for roughly one-third of the price spike.A crucial part of the solution, he added, was that the economy needed more houses to help lower prices.Instead, by sharply lifting interest rates, and by extension mortgage rates, a hawkish turn in monetary policy created headwinds to ramping up residential housing construction.Indeed, housing starts have fallen substantially since monetary policy turned hawkish in March 2022, as shown in the chart below.Stiglitz added that while the US economy will do pretty well vs. the rest of the world overall, the sharp rise in interest rates will remain a threat to growth in 2024.He cites the long and variable impact of monetary policy as a lingering headwind, noting that policy changes can take time to fully impact the economy, for good or ill.Stiglitzs bona fides in the dismal science are reason enough to refrain from dismissing his warning, but for the moment the US economic profile continues to defy the darker forecasts from various corners over the past year.Yesterdays first-quarter estimate of US GDP via the Atlanta Feds GDPNow model (as of Feb. 7), for example, reflects a solid increase in expected output thats in line with the stronger-than-expected Q4 rise reported by the government.Meanwhile, CapitalSpectator.coms sister publication  The US Business Cycle Risk Report  continues to estimate the probability that an NBER-defined recession has started or is imminent at a low 1% (as of Feb. 2), based on the Composite Recession Probability Indicator, which combines estimates from several models.Looking beyond the immediate future in the cause of making high-confidence forecasts is extremely challenging for business-cycle analytics and so caution is recommended on this front.Nonetheless, Stiglitzs warning isnt easily dismissed. But if we forgo forecasts, the current numbers strongly suggest that recession risk is low  a profile that even a Nobel-prize-winning economist would have a hard time refuting, at least for now."

XAU/USD
's decline. However, uncertainty about when the Fed will start to cut interest rates is restraining the potential bullish trend in gold because high-interest rates increase the opportunity cost of owning gold. Fed officials say they need more evidence of inflation heading towards the 2% target before easing monetary policy. Still, one factor behind gold's gains is the ongoing concerns about the US regional banking sector after Moody's (NYSE:
MCO
) downgrade of New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:
NYCB
) to non-investment grade. This event highlighted concerns about regional banks' funding and liquidity. Thus, gold may get an additional boost as it performs well in times of political and economic uncertainty.XAU/USD was declining during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The most important report to watch today is the US Jobless Claims report at 1:30 p.m. UTC. If jobless claims rise, XAU/USD may have bullish momentum. Otherwise, the sideways trend in XAU/USD may continue.

EUR/USD
may be caused by technical factors as bears took profit on their short positions. Still, some fundamental factors also affect the currency pair as the market hasn't fully excluded the possibility of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in March. Moreover, the probability of a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut in May has risen to around 60%. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) officials have been giving hawkish signals lately. The ECB board member Isabel Schnabel told the Financial Times that the central bank must be patient with cutting interest rates as inflation could accelerate again.EUR/USD was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders should focus on the US Jobless Claims report coming out at 1:30 p.m. UTC. Higher-than-expected figures may increase the likelihood of a US interest rate cut in May, pushing EUR/USD higher. Lower-than-expected results may help prolong the long-term bearish trend in EUR/USD, potentially bringing the pair below 1.07500. Also, the president of Richmond Fed, Thomas Barkin, will deliver two speeches today at 1:30 p.m. and 5:05 p.m. UTC. His comments might also provoke some volatility in all USD pairs.The Japanese yen (JPY) lost 0.16% on Wednesday despite the weakening US Dollar Index (DXY).USD/JPY
has struggled to find a clear direction for over a month. Sideways trading has prevailed as traders assess the impact of contradictory fundamental factors. On the one hand, the probability of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) has declined, pushing the US dollar higher. On the other hand, traders are reluctant to sell JPY as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) remains the only central bank among the G7 countries, which is expected to raise its base rate this year. Shinichi Uchida, the BOJ deputy governor, hinted yesterday that the central bank will likely end its asset purchases soon. He also said ending negative interest rates would be equivalent to hiking short-term interest rates by 0.1%. Thus, the market currently prices in more than a 50% probability that negative rates in Japan will end in April.USD/JPY rose in the Asian and early European trading sessions but failed to break above the critical 149.000 level. Today, the focus is on the US data. The Jobless Claims report will be released at 1:30 p.m. UTC. A better-than-expected report revealing the strength of the US jobs market will likely push USD/JPY above 149.000. If weekly unemployment claims rise faster than the market expects, the bullish trend in USD/JPY may reverse and bring the pair towards 148.000."
Investing.com,Here's Why TIPS Deserve a Place in Your Portfolio,2024-02-08,0.666667,"It is interesting to me that, with as important and liquid as the inflation-linked bond market is, the tactical allocation between TIPS and nominal bonds is at best an afterthought for most investors.Perhaps this is because TIPS  if you think in nominal space like most investors do  can be quirky and complex to analyze on a bond-by-bond basis.Heres a picture of the TIPS yield curve. The red line is the way that TIPS real yields are calculated, and therefore the curve as perceived in the market.The green line is the true yield curve, adjusting for the way the seasonality of inflation prints affects each particular bond.Thats understandable, but I dont think its sufficient. Most investors do not invest in individual bonds, especially in the TIPS space.They invest via mutual funds or ETFs, although the laddering of TIPS to form a crude inflation-linked annuity is a popular approach amongst do-it-yourselfers.So why do
so many investors
own nominal bonds, instead of inflation-linked bonds, as an immutable strategic allocation?Even those who make occasional tactical shifts into TIPS seem to do so when they are expecting inflation to rise, and so are making a macro call instead of a quantitative call.But there are lots of times when owning TIPS instead of nominal bonds is just a good bet, regardless of your immediate inflation view.The most obvious one I wrote about back in March 2020 was 
The Big Bet of 10-year Breakevens at 0.94%
.""Ive also written generally about why you might want to be long inflation-linked bonds even if the current level of implied inflation (aka breakevens) is near to fair based on your view about the trajectory of inflation.(See 
A Guess at the Value of Long Inflation Tails
 as an example).But the times when just being long TIPS instead of nominal or being long breakevens or inflation swaps if you do it as a leveraged play is advantageous are not limited to unusual circumstances.TIPS also have tended to be systematically cheap over long periods, which
Ive also documented
.Another way to consider the same question is to ask, If I bought 10-year breakevens when they were at a particular level, how would I have done it historically?Equivalently, if I had switched into 10y TIPS, instead of
10y Treasuries
, when the spread was at a particular level, how much would I have out- or under-performed historically? The chart below answers that question.I went back to February 1998. For each of 6,453 days (ending in June 2023 since I had to look forward 6 months), I considered the starting 10-year breakeven rate and calculated the return to being long that breakeven over the next 6 months.That return is dependent on the relative yields of the different securities, how those yields (and hence the breakeven) changed over time, and how actual inflation developed.Its worth pointing out that this time period, core inflation was below 3% for 90% of the time. Ergo, you wouldnt expect to have lots of big wins because of inflation surprise, although of course toward the end of the historical period you did.The chart shows for each bin (I threw all 58 days with 10-year breakevens lower than 0.75% into the same bucket, which turned out to be equal to the number of days in the 2.75%-3.00% bucket) what the average 6-month return was to being long 10-year breakevens along with the 10th percentile and 90th percentile.So you can see that
on average
, you didnt lose money being long breakevens anywhere under 2.50%, despite the fact that inflation throughout this period was very low.Thats a function of what I said before, that TIPS in general were cheap throughout this period. And if you bought breakevens (or switched into TIPS) any time that the breakeven was below 1.5%, you had a 90% or better chance of winning.Naturally, it shouldnt be a surprise that if you buy breakevens at a cheap level  as with any asset  you stand a better chance of winning than if you bought it at a dear level.What is a little more of a surprise is that there hasnt historically been very much pain, on average, to being long breakevens even when they are high. In fact, unless you bought breakevens above 2.75%  basically, one event in 2022  you had at least a 40% chance of winning your bet (10y TIPS outperforming).This isnt to say that there arent a lot of ways to lose, trade or invest in TIPS.Like any other investment, they can lose money and in 2022-2023 being naked long TIPS was almost as painful as being naked long any other fixed-income instrument.Almost
. You did
lots
better than if youd owned nominal Treasuries through the same episode!***I used the Bloomberg US 10-year Breakeven Inflation Index, which is a total return index (BXIIUB10 Index on Bloomberg), from its inception in 2006; prior to that I used Enduring Investments calculations which utilized roughly the same methodology."
Investing.com,"S&P 500 Hits Record, Chinese Deflation Deepens",2024-02-08,0.666667,"Hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve members continued to make the headlines in the US, yesterday, with Susan Collins, Thomas Barkin and a new Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, all saying the same exact thing: that there is no hurry for the US to cut the interest rates when the economic data points at such a surprising and historical resilience to the modern times most aggressive rate hikes.But knowing that the Fed is done hiking its rates and the expectation that the next move from the Fed will be a rate cut is enough to keep the market in a sweet spot. A delay in the timing of the first rate cut is
even
perceived as a good thing: the US economy is doing so well that there is no urge to cut the rates right away. And thats
tant mieux
for your corporate earnings.This is how the US economy shrugs off the latest commercial real estate worries that cost the New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:
NYCB
) more than half of its value. And even though the worries jumped to Germanys Deutsche Pfandbriefbank, the stress is nowhere to be felt on the sovereign bond or index level. On the contrary, the US had a record-breaking auction for its 10-year bonds yesterday, where it sold $42bn worth of notes at a lower-than-anticipated yield. The strong demand for the
US 10-year
papers hints that investors continue to binge buy the US 10-year papers while sitting patiently in the waiting room and watching the major US indices record-breaking race to occupy themselves. You could think that the regional bank stress could bring the Fed to cut the rates earlier than otherwise, but thats not necessarily what we sense in the market today, so I am sticking to my rate-cut expectation gun to explain why the US 10-year papers saw such a strong demand yesterday.In Germany, the 10-year bund yield didnt blink to Pfandbriefbank jitters, the
DAX
and the
Stoxx 600
were down on Wednesday but the declines remained too soft to hint at panic, while the
S&P 500
renewed record and traded at a spitting distance from the 5000 psychological mark. Thats a powerful psychological milestone mind you, and it could trigger some profit-taking due to the overbought market conditions and bubbling valuations. But the S&P 500s rally is backed by the anticipation of upcoming rate cuts and robust earnings. And sentiment in both yields and earnings remains supportive. In this respect, Disney followed in the footsteps of its happy tech peers yesterday and rose almost 7% in the after-hours trading after reporting better-than-expected earnings and issuing an upbeat profit outlook.Alls well that ends well.The slowdown in the US sovereign selloff is weighing on the
US dollar
. The
dollar index
returned below its 100-DMA. The fact that central bankers around the world, like the ones in Europe and Australia, are also pushing back on early rate cut expectations certainly play a role in the dollars limited gains. In this context, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) warned earlier this week that the bank could even think of tightening the financial conditions if inflation didnt ease to levels that they consider being acceptable. The hawkish accompanying statement from the RBA helped the
AUD/USD
limit losses near the 65 cents level earlier this week. But the pair remains offered into the 100-DMA, and the morose inflation figures from China dont help cheer up the bulls.China announced this morning that deflation accelerated in January to -0.8% y-o-y, faster than a 0.5% deflation penciled in by analysts and the fastest price drop in over 14 years. In plain English, it means that the Chinese efforts to boost growth and bring inflation back are not working according to the plan. Money poured into the Chinese system doesnt circulate in a way to stimulate the economy  blame people who lost confidence  and the radical measures that the government has put in place to prop up equity valuations hardly help Chinas battered stock markets to get back on their feet. Today, sentiment in the CPI 300 index is mixed. I was writing yesterday that a deeper-than-expected deflation number will certainly encourage Chinese authorities to announce more stimulus measures. But measures alone wont help getting the Chinese markets heads above water if investors dont play along.Another worry about the Chinese recovery is that because the Chinese dream has been dashed by a $7 trillion selloff in the equity markets, many could be tempted to take their loss and walk away in the slightest recovery. In summary, the road to a sustainable recovery seems far away.Zooming in, Alibaba (NYSE:
BABA
) missed the opportunity to break above its down-trending channel that has been building since last August as its shares dived 6% after its sales missed expectations in the latest Q4 report. The latter offset a $25bn buyback program that the company has just announced. Alibabas price chart over the past 5 years is the best summary of how things went down for Chinese equities as Xi-led government was busy beating their tech gems with baseball bats, imposing absurd COVID-zero rules, and getting both the Chinese consumers and foreign investors on their back. Here we are today, waiting for more measures to cheer us up."
Investing.com,Can the Bull Market Defy the Warning Signs?,2024-02-09,0.666667,"The bubble in no holds barred monetary policy (birthed under Alan Greenspan) and the bullish markets it benefits are in their third decadeGold
, meanwhile, will not be ready until the post bubbleThis is an article from a source, yours truly, who considers it his job to define the top-down macro before trying to pick stocks. In other words, it is important to get the big picture macro, as well as its shorter-term rotations, right before trying to select stocks and the sectors they reside in.In an extreme example, the gold mining sector has been most often impaired by the bubble on macro, including its inflationary phases, not helped by it. Post-bubble will be a different story. But you cant change the macro because of want. It will change when it is good and ready.In the year 2001 Sir Alan Greenspan was forced to abandon his stately Maestro image in favor of a more desperate, even panicky version of himself. That desperation was put into effect by the various inflationary means used to birth and blow the credit bubble, which launched the real estate/mortgage bubble and eventually, the great stock market bull that persists to this day.This is ancient history (2003-2008), but it was an important time when we as market participants were taken down the rabbit hole, whether we liked it or not. Fittingly, the end of this historical phase was resolved in a righteous market liquidation of Q4, 2008.By then it was Ben the Hero Bernankes turn to try his hand at inflationary bubble making, and inflationary bubble-make he sure did. New and unusual methods of QE/Bond Manipulation/ZIRP and a new twist on things in order to
sanitize
(the actual word the Fed used back then) inflation signals out of the macro, aptly named Operation Twist.You think this was anything remotely resembling normal? This twist not surprisingly came after the Bernanke Fed had cooked up inflationary operations of its own that were threatening to point a finger right at these big-brained monetary/economic intellectuals that were primary in creating every inflation problem since 2001.Inflation begins with money printing by various means. The pure definition is inflation of money supplies chasing finite assets. Inflation was turned on like a spigot whenever our remote-controlling monetary managers wished. Later, in its
effects
come the cost-push inflationary problems like those of the recent cycle.The Federal Reserve actually saw the potential for its previous inflationary episodes (Greenspan era into the Bernanke era) to get out of hand and concocted a bond market manipulation scheme to
paint
inflation right out of the picture. And guess what? The market bought it. Market players bought it. Lapped it up like dogs. They kicked the
10yr-2yr yield
curve into a flattening phase and Goldilocks-flavored economic boom. That was generally the 2013 to 2019 era generally attended by a strong US dollar.To this day, the dogs devour every morsel thrown their way and their confidence in our monetary regulators is intact, by definition. Every time a still-hot economic or inflation signal comes in the market quakes in its boots, and that includes the anti-bubble, gold. Confidence = intact. Gold is for when intact becomes unglued.Hence, the only thing a right-minded market participant can do (excluding the vast majority who still think its normal as their financial advisers continue to cost average up into nosebleed territory) is not short it in a committed fashion, play it from the long side with risk management or sit and collect the cash income that the Fed is paying you to take advantage of.As for speculating from the long side, what has been working best over the last year is what we originally projected a year ago, the Goldilocks stuff, as a market in full submission to the Feds every utterance from its various orifices continues to view cost-push inflation implied in the January Payrolls report and even a slight uptick in Manufacturing (well take a brief look at the latest ISM in this weekends NFTRH report) with fear of the Fed, which in turn has been driving the US dollar.So confidence is intact, by definition. Markets are flat-out bullish. AI is going to make us all rich (well, I sold SMCI too soon, collecting
only
a +/- 70% profit on two separate trades). Actually, I had to sell SMCI just as I had to sell ANET before it because my DNA directs me not to be a hype follower and by extension, anything resembling a committed bubble player.This graph produced by John Hussman was taken from a more extensive article, which you may want to check out. Feel free to reference the NFTRH Links page any time, as youll find Doc Hussman and many other worthwhile sources there (market tools, economic data, industry news/analysis, biased and unbiased analysis alike, and so much more). Ive built that links page for my own reference. Why not bookmark it for yourself?Here Hussman illustrates in one picture that our bullish markets and strong economy are the products of leverage. In an ongoing bubble this does not matter. In a bursting bubble? Well, it matters.So the above is a bullish picture at high risk because it is the product of leverage to a growing debt pile and by extension, deficits. That is what the economy and associated bull market are built upon. Play it if you will, but also understand it for what it is.For those submitting to the Feds every utterance (not to mention to their mainstream financial advisers assurances that they are professionally managing their wealth in the ways of tradition), its all good as long as the bubble in policy and associated markets and thus,
confidence
are intact.Other indicators we use in NFTRH show what we have been noting for months; that the market is two things 1) bullish and 2) at high risk. To save room for a more pointed discussion about individual equities and strategy in the upcoming
NFTRH 796
, Ill drop a cavalcade of our indicators in this public article for subscribers and the public alike to review.Again, I want to remind you that the Goldilocks link above is from a year ago when nobody else was talking Goldilocks and a relative few were talking bullish in general. I point that out because when I write highly negative articles like I perceive this one to be, proven credibility (that Ive not been a perma-bear, perma-bug, or perma anything else to this point) is important. I simply have to write about what I see and I dont care whose agenda it may or may not serve.On that note, risk is play in the form of sentiment and in the form of other indicators like the extreme low in the defensive Healthcare sector to the broad
SPX
. The
XLV
/SPY ratio has historically and reliably spiked upward into and during bear markets and hard corrections. The exception was 2012  2016 when there was a lot of healthcare-related political noise in the picture. The ratio shows
high risk to equities and yet a still bullish situation
.Speaking of a still bullish situation, the
Semiconductor > Tech > Broad
leadership chain has been a staple in NFTRH, keeping us from attempting an active bearish orientation and/or keeping us with a bullish view (risk and all).
SOX
leading
NDX
and NDX leading SPX is the bullish leadership recipe. Its intact, if not yet fully baked.As for gold, it is not yet signaling either a bear market or an illegitimate * bull market for stocks. During the un-shaded period from 2002 to 2011 the stock market spent the majority of the time in an apparent bull market. Stocks were going up! Gold went up better. Currently, SPX/Gold shows stock bulls sleeping soundly.* Well, thats debatable considering the majority of charts in this article.
But work with me here.However, the
Copper
/Gold ratio shows that aside from the strong dollar/Goldilocks stuff, a down economic cycle and stock market bear are just itching to come into play. Post-election, perhaps? Can they hold it together that long?
NFTRH 795
put on its tin foil hat last weekend and took a hard look at that question, both pros and cons.Meanwhile, another risk indicator to a still bullish market situation is the current state of the
VIX
vs. the bulling SPX. Its not a major thing, visually. But historically the VIX has tended to travel at least flat with a positive bias prior to SPX corrections. Today? Well, VIX is traveling with a positive bias in defiance of the big bull move in SPX.We anticipated, if not predicted a bull move in SPX, after all. Here is a chart Ive shown publicly on several occasions as 2023 went about its business of building a higher-risk situation with the desired ingredient to make a truly high-risk situation a higher high in SPX. The anticipation was for anything from a slightly higher high double top to an upside suck em in FOMO extravaganza and upside blow-off. The market is agitating for the latter now.With respect to the above, ironically the recent bump up in Fed hawkishness could sustain the bull longer than if they had remained stapled to the March rate cut view. Its when the Fed is finally compelled to start cutting to get in line with the declining
2-year yield
that max bear damage has been inflicted. I dont say so. The chart and history say so.There are many more indicators we use. From Libor Yields to High Yield Spreads to yield curves and more that are currently telling us theGold, not mentioned much in this article, nonetheless lays in wait for the post-bubble *. Ill continue to respect the idea that a major post-bubble indicator kicked in in 2022. That would be in the in the form of the king of NFTRH indicators, the Continuum, which after years of keeping us aware that inflationary policymakers were in full control (the Continuum indicated pleasant disinflation, after all) smashed its limiting moving averages. And you wonder why todays Fed is so zealous about fighting inflation?* Post-bubble will be the only macro that will sustain an extended and potentially epic move in the gold mining industry because by then the gold mining products relationship to cyclical and risk on asset markets will leverage the miners bottom lines to the upside. This is the Bob Hoye playbook, but its been elusive over the bubble years (decades) and its still not quite time yet."
Investing.com,"Stocks, Rates Stall at Key Resistances",2024-02-09,0.666667,"So, it was another rather boring day, with the
S&P 500
finishing flat, rates up, the
dollar
up, and implied volatility somewhat higher. This has been a very odd earnings season.Last night, I noted a rising wedge in the S&P 500, and as of yesterdays close, the index is pretty much out of room.There might be a little bit more time it could buy, but not much. As I mentioned yesterday, these patterns are bearish by definition.However, just because something is bearish doesnt mean it has to break lower.Normally, I would have much more confidence in this pattern, but given how difficult the last four months have been for my S&P 500 views, I am quite hesitant about it.If the pattern breaks lower, then it could retrace back to its origin at 4850. Where it goes from there, I would have to see.If it reaches 4,850, a lot can start to happen because I have numerous trend lines converging in that region. If these trend lines begin to break, things could start to happen.I noted earlier that implied volatility somewhat increased yesterday, and thats because the
VIX
was essentially flat, but the VVIX rose by 3% to 83, marking an increase for two consecutive days.Sometimes, when the VVIX starts to rise, the VIX isnt too far behind.The VVIX measures the implied volatility of the VIX, and when the implied volatility of the VIX starts to rise, it suggests to me that something is happening beneath the surface to cause this.Part of the reason why we see the VIX remain below 13 to 14 is due to the significant gamma buildup around the options expiration next Wednesday, yes, February 14th.Its unusual to see the VIX options expiration (OPEX) occur on the second Wednesday of the month, but thats what the calendar indicates.I bring this up because its interesting to observe implied volatility levels rising from beneath, while options flows are helping to keep the VIX contained.Meanwhile, the
30-year bond
auction yesterday went fine, yet we still saw the 30-year and the
10-year
rates move higher.The 10-year is very close to breaking out and rising above the 4.20% region. If that happens, I think we could see it rise to around 4.35% to start with.Im also keeping an eye on the
Mexican Peso
, of all things, because it looks like a double bottom is in the process of forming, mixed in with a diamond reversal pattern.Theres solid momentum forming on the RSI, which has been pushing higher since June.When you invert the peso, it becomes easier to see the relationship between the Peso and the S&P 500.These relationships between the S&P 500 and currencies seem to exist widely and are a function of the dollar's weakening and strengthening.This emphasizes how much of the market movements have to do with changes in financial conditions. It is also evident that the S&P 500 and the peso are diverging.Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) is also diverging from the S&P 500 and appears to be in a more bearish formation than the S&P 500. A close below $186 likely sets up a drop back to around $167.It almost looks like Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) has broken the neckline of a head and shoulders pattern.Its not clear at this point, but I can easily get the impression that if this is indeed the confirmation of the pattern, then the losses in the stock arent over yet.Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) exhibited a notable reversal candle yesterday, after moving above yesterdays high and then closing below yesterdays close.However, given how overbought it is, and the fact that the call wall for the stock for this week and next week is at $700, theres probably a good reason why the stock has struggled in this region over the last four days.AnywayYouTube Video Original Post"

Inflation is expected to fall over the coming months but a greater decline in January could help the case of cutting rates sooner. Equally, a higher number could be a massive setback and suggest progress has stalled which could see rate expectations pared back again.The jobs report on Monday is also key, most notably the average earnings component, as this is a major contributor to price pressures. Particularly in the services sector, an area central banks are most concerned about when it comes to getting inflation sustainably back to 2%.

Investing.com,Fed Rate Cuts Should Deepen the Secular Housing Crisis in America,2024-02-09,0.666667,"The cost of housing remains a hot-button topic with both Millennials and Gen-Z. Plenty of articles and commentaries address the concern of supply and affordability, with the younger generations getting hit the hardest. Such was the subject of this recent
CNET article:The chart below of the housing affordability index certainly supports those claims.As noted by CNET, there are many apparent reasons causing housing to be unaffordable, from a lack of supply to increased mortgage rates and rising prices. Over the last couple of years, as the Fed aggressively hiked interest rates, the supply of homes on the market has grown.Such is because higher interest rates lead to higher mortgage rates and higher monthly payments for homes. It is also worth noting that previously when the supply of homes exceeded eight months, the economy was in a recession.At the same time, higher interest rates and increased supply should equate to lower home prices and, therefore, create more

affordability. As shown, such was the case in prior periods, but post-pandemic housing prices skyrocketed as
stimulus checks
fueled a rash of buyers.As is always the case with everything in economics, price is ALWAYS a function of supply versus demand.The following economic illustration is taught in every
Econ 101
class. Unsurprisingly, inflation is the consequence if supply is restricted and demand increases.While such was the case following the economic shutdown in 2020, the current housing affordability problem is a function of bad decisions made at the turn of the century. Before 2000, the average home buyer needed good credit and a 20% down payment. Those constraints kept demand and supply in balance to some degree. While housing increased with inflation, median household incomes could keep pace.However, in the late 90s, banks and realtors lobbied Congress heavily to change the laws to allow more people to buy homes. Alan Greenspan, then Fed Chairman, pushed adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage companies began using split mortgages to bypass the need for mortgage insurance, and credit requirements were eased for borrowers. By 2007, mortgages were being given to subprime borrowers with no credit and no verifiable sources of income. These actions inevitably led to increased demand that outpaced available supply, pushing home prices well above what incomes could afford.This episode in the housing market resulted from zero-interest policies by the Federal Reserve. That policy and massive liquidity injections into the financial markets brought hoards of speculators, from individuals to institutions.Institutional players like Blackstone (NYSE:
BX
), Blackrock (NYSE:
BLK
), and many others purchased 44% of all single-family homes in 2023 to turn them into rentals.
As prices rose, advances like AirBnB (NASDAQ:
ABNB
) brought more demand from individuals for rentals, further reducing the available housing pool. Those influences lead to even higher prices for available inventory.Notably, it isnt a lack of housing construction. The Total Housing Activity Index is not far from its all-time highs following the 2020 pandemic housing rush. The issue is the removal of too many homes by
non-home buyers
from the available inventory.Furthermore, existing home sales are absent. Current homeowners are unwilling to sell homes with a 4% mortgage rate to buy a home with a 7% mortgage. As shown, existing home sales remain remarkably absent.All of these actions have exacerbated the problem. At the root of it all is the Federal Reserve, keeping interest rates too low for too long. Oversupplying liquidity and creating repeated surges in home prices. It is not a far stretch to realize the bulk of the housing problem directly results from Governmental forces.Sen. Elizabeth Warren and three other lawmakers are pushing Jerome Powell
to lower interest rates at the upcoming Fed meeting to make housing more affordable.As discussed above, lowering interest rates is not the solution to lowering housing prices. Lower interest rates would bring more buyers into a market already short inventory, thereby increasing home prices.We can already see the impact of lower mortgage rates on home prices just since October. Prices rose as yields fell on hopes the Federal Reserve would cut rates in 2024. If mortgage rates revert to 4%, where they were during most of the last decade, home prices will significantly increase.There is only one solution to return home prices to affordability for most of the population. That is to reduce the existing demand. Here are a few measures that could help solve the problem:Yes, those are very tough standards to meet and initially would exclude many from home ownership. But, home ownership should be a demanding standard to meet, as the cost of home ownership is high.For the individual, such standards would ensure that home ownership is feasible and that such ownership, along with the subsequent fees, taxes, maintenance costs, etc., would still allow for financial stability. For the lenders, it would reduce the liability of another financial crisis to almost zero, as the housing markets stability would be inevitable.But most importantly, such strict standards would immediately cause an evaporation of housing demand. With a complete lack of demand, housing prices would fall and reverse the vast appreciation caused by a decade of fiscal and monetary largesse. Yes, it would be a very tough market until those excesses reverse, but such is the consequence of allowing banks and institutions to run amok in the housing market."
Investing.com,Gold Rises on Safe-Haven Demand; EUR/USD Recovers Slightly Amid a Strong US Dollar,2024-02-09,0.333333,"The gold (XAU) price remained near 2,030 on Thursday, largely unchanged from yesterday. Overall, the strong
US dollar
and higher Treasury yields still pressure
XAU/USD
.Yesterday's strong US employment figures have further weakened the chance of an interest rate reduction this spring. Federal Reserve (Fed) officials also countered speculation about future rate cuts. Susan Collins, Boston Fed President, remarked that the current policy is suitably positioned, indicating that easing the monetary policy might be considered later in the year. 'The reality on the ground is that the US economy continues to be fairly firm, and that means that the Fed has very little latitude at this stage to start cutting rates,' stated Bart Melek, the head of commodity strategies at T.D. Securities. He added that 'for gold to rally, we have to start seeing evidence that the economy indeed is slowing down in a material way and that inflation is trending lower on a sustained basis.' Market sentiment has adjusted, now estimating the probability of a rate cut in March at under 20%, down from the 60% likelihood expected at the year's start. Moreover, ongoing geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East haven't substantially boosted XAU/USD.Today, XAU/USD slightly declined during the early European trading session. While there will be no significant data releases today, tensions in the Middle East continue escalating: Israel launched strikes on areas in Rafah, a southern border city, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined a truce proposal from Hamas. 'Spot gold is biased to test support at $2,030 per ounce, with a good chance of breaking below this level and falling towards $2,018,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.The euro (EUR) gained 0.05% on Thursday, rising for the third consecutive day despite strong US macro data.Yesterday's US Jobless Claims report once again pointed to a resilient US labor market, reinforcing the expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may not rush to cut interest rates this spring. As a result, the
US Dollar Index
(DXY) continues to move near multi-month highs, while the euro recovers only slowly. 'If the dollar is going to weaken, we're going to need to see some attenuation of the robustness in the US data and some improvement in the data in Europe and China,' said Thierry Wizman, a global FX and interest rates strategist at Macquarie.Meanwhile, expectations for an imminent rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) have also weakened. Pierre Wunsch, chief of the Belgian central bank, said there wasn't enough evidence for the regulator to start easing its monetary policy. Overall, monetary policy expectations on both sides of the Atlantic are more or less balanced as traders expect roughly the same amount of interest rate cuts in 2024 by both the ECB and the Fed. Thus, the fundamental pressure on
EUR/USD
is mixed, ensuring sideways trading.EUR/USD was declining slightly in the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the formal macroeconomic calendar is rather uneventful, so volatility will probably remain low. Still, some traders may prefer to close their positions before the weekend, resulting in sharp movements. Technically, EUR/USD will probably continue to remain under bearish pressure as long as the price remains below the important 1.08000 level.The Canadian dollar (CAD) gained 0.06% on Thursday as the price of
crude oil
, Canada's major export item, surged by more than 3% on the Israel ceasefire rejection.USD/CAD
has been in an uptrend since the end of 2023, when the market started to scale back on its expectations for an early rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed). At the same time, the market doesn't expect the Bank of Canada (BOC) to be particularly dovish, either. Fundamentally, the divergence between US and Canadian monetary policies favors the Canadian dollar. That is because investors expect more interest rate cuts from the Fed than from the BOC. According to the interest rate swap market data, traders currently price in more than 115 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the Fed and just under 80 bps of cuts by the BOC in 2024. Indeed, the protocols from the recent BOC meeting confirmed that policymakers were concerned about cutting borrowing costs too soon amid persistent inflation.USD/CAD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the main event for CAD traders is the release of the monthly employment statistics at 1:30 p.m. UTC. The data release usually affects the market significantly. The report includes the latest nonfarm employment figures and unemployment rateone of the key metrics the regulator uses to decide on changes in monetary policy. If employment rises faster than expected and the unemployment rate drops, the short-term bearish trend in USD/CAD may continue, bringing the pair down towards the critical 1.34000 level. Worse-than-expected results may lead to a sharp upward correction in USD/CAD, possibly taking the pair above the important 1.35000 level."
Investing.com,"S&P 500 Rallies, Dollar Struggles and Yen Strengthens Amid CPI Data",2024-02-09,0.666667,"The strong demand for the US 30-year bond auction, which followed two other strong
3-year
and
10-year
auctions this week triggered no appetite across the US bonds space yesterday, most probably because the
30-year
paper is a long maturity paper and is mostly purchased by insurance and pension funds. But the week has been successful for the US Treasury Department which saw a solid demand for its debt this week, and thats thanks to the expectation that the rates will fall  sometime this year  and that the Treasury will also slow down the pace of purchases moving forward.Appetite in risk assets remains robust. The
S&P 500 index
shortly traded at the 5000 psychological mark before closing a few points below this level. The rally is not only fueled by rate cut expectations and AI speculation but is also backed  to some extent  by encouraging tech earnings from the stars of the league. Note that Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
), Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
), Alphabet (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
), Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) and Meta (NASDAQ:
META
) generated nearly $140bn cash from their operations last quarter. That was the highest on record.The Bureau of Statistics will release the CPI revisions today, which consist of the revised month-over-month CPI figures for the past five years, incorporating some adjustments. Whats important to know is that the non-seasonally adjusted data remains unchanged, hence the year-over-year figures for the entire year will remain the same.Why do people care? Normally, they dont, because these changes are small and dont change the end result. But last year, the markets cared because the revisions were more significant than usual and resulted in lower adjusted m-o-m inflation numbers for the first half and higher revisions for the second half  a hint that the moderation in inflation was not as good as thought in the second half of 2022. The latter boosted the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hike expectations and fueled the
US 2-year yield
. Todays revisions could reveal if the downtrending US inflation numbers hide a more significant slowdown or a late pickup. If the revisions hint at a slowing momentum in monthly inflation figures, the Fed doves should come back in charge and the
dollar
should ease. If the monthly revisions warn that inflation may not be slowing as fast as we think, the Fed doves will further retreat, and the dollar should gain. And if there are no major revisions, well all eyes will turn to next Tuesday, regular CPI update. And so goes life.The US dollar struggles to gain further momentum above the 100-DMA. But the US economys positive divergence from the rest of the developed nations, its healthy jobs market, its decent fiscal spending are supporting the idea that the Fed is  maybe  not the best candidate to begin the pivot dance. The European Central Bank (ECB) for example is in a better position to start cutting its interest rates to prop up its depressed economies. That idea keeps the
EUR/USD
offered near its own 100-DMA  which stands near 1.0780. Trend and momentum indicators remain comfortable negative and supportive of a deeper downside move in the EUR/USD. Today, the German inflation data is expected to confirm a slowdown below the 3% in January  that should help the bears stay in charge.Elsewhere, the yen bulls are feeling the heat of a totally unexpected return to nearly 150 level at the start of this year. The
USD/JPY
is now trading above the 149 level, and the BoJ hawks are giving in to the expectation that the Japs wont move soon or quick enough to make 2024 the year of the yen. The USD/JPYs positive trend becomes increasingly vulnerable to verbal intervention as we approach the 150 level.In energy, we see a second positive attempt above the $76pb level, despite a 5.5-mio barrel build in the US inventories. The rising geopolitical tensions, strong US growth, and Chinese stimulus remain supportive for another attempt above the 200-DMA  near $77.50pb."

Investing.com,"Despite a Record Travel Boom, Chinas Economic Rebound Falls Short",2024-02-12,0.666667,"A little over a year ago, the world watched as China reopened its doors after three long years of strict pandemic lockdowns. Expectations were high for a robust economic recovery, fueled by pent-up demand and consumer spending.The reality has been starkly different. Despite a bustling travel season around Chinas Lunar New Yearwith a record 9 billion domestic trips expected, 80 million by airthe anticipated economic rebound has largely failed to materialize, even as world markets have surged to record to near-record highs.This downturn appears not to be just a temporary blip, but a sign of deeper structural issues within the Chinese economy. The nations gross domestic product (GDP) reportedly grew 5.2% in 2023, an admirable print at first glance, but it masks underlying challenges. A closer look reveals a significant slowdown from the pre-pandemic era of consistent +6% growth. Select industries such as electric vehicles (EVs) saw remarkable sales in China last year, but this strength hasnt been enough to offset serious weaknesses in other sectors, particularly real estate, which remains a major drag on the economy.Our decision to close the China Region Fund last year was a move predicated on recognizing early signs of these economic challenges. Its a decision that, in hindsight, has been vindicated. The ongoing property sector slump and regulatory uncertainties have further exacerbated investor apprehension, leading to a significant outflow of $68.7 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) for the first time since 2018.Chinese equities continue to underperform. Both mainland stocks and those listed in Hong Kong ended 2023 with losses, even as other Asia-Pacific markets rallied. Remarkably, Japans
Nikkei 225
is poised to hit a new all-time high after 34 years.This year isnt off to a great start for Chinese stocks, either. The CSI 300 shed over 7% in January, while the Hang Seng lost over 9%.Indeed, in a shift not seen in over 20 years, Mexico outpaced China last year to become the top supplier of imports to the U.S. This change highlights the escalating strains between Washington and Beijing, alongside American initiatives to source more goods from closer, more allied nations.Recent data from the Commerce Department indicates that imports from Mexico to the U.S. increased nearly 5% from 2022 to 2023, reaching over $475 billion. Conversely, the import value from China saw a sharp decline of 20%, falling to $427 billion.Efforts to stabilize the Chinese market have so far failed to lift investor confidence. Last Tuesday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced plans to halt the practice of brokerages borrowing shares to lend them out and to limit the scope of what's referred to as the securities re-lending market, in a move aimed at reining in short-selling activities.This came a day after the regulator vowed zero tolerance against short sellers, warning them they could lose their shirts and rot in jail, according to reporting by Reuters.These regulatory steps were introduced after the Chinese government declared in October 2023 that it would issue 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) in Chinese Government Bonds (CGB) to support local government finances and fund infrastructure projects in areas affected by natural disasters over the past year.The move was meant to send a signal to global markets that China is pro-growth again, but as Morgan Stanleys Schuyler Hooper writes, the strategy is seen as merely a repeat of Chinas old policy playbook, where they rely on investment to prop up economic growth, while growth in consumption, export, property and private investment remains sluggish.The risk, Hooper points out, is a short-lived cyclical rebound amid a longer-term secular slowdown in the Chinese market.The Chinese government faces a daunting task in addressing the deep-seated issues within its economy. Chaos in the real estate market, local government debt and deflationary pressures are significant hurdles to sustained growth. Geopolitical tensions add another layer of complexity.The situation serves as a reminder of the importance of diversification and the need to remain agile.

And lack of stocks offering exposure to Valentines themes, from flowers to gift cards. A historic Valentines Day stock market effect is a lesser-known technical support for markets.
Valentines 5th biggest consumer event of year with $182 spend
Valentines Day is the 5th largest spending event of the year. After Back-to-School/College, Christmas, and Mothers and Fathers Day. In the US romantics are forecast to spend a combined $26 billion, or an average $182 per person. This is the latest test for the resilient consumer that has near single-handedly kept the US out of recession. Helped by both strong job's growth and rising inflation-adjusted wages. Candy, cards, flowers, an evening out, jewellery and clothing are the most common gifts. Whilst 31% plan to buy their pets a Valentines gift. This is more than for friends (28%) or co-workers (16%).
Candy leading present but all-time-high cocoa prices make expensive
But that box of chocolates is going to cost more. US sweets inflation is running at more than twice the headline rate. Cocoa prices having doubled to all-time-high $5,200/ton in the past year. As El Nino drove harvest disruption in the dominant West Africa producers Ivory Coast and Ghana. And it may get worse before it gets better. As manufacturers like Switzerlands Barry Callebaut (BARN.ZU) and Nestle (NESN.ZU) or the US Hershey (HSY) run through there lower-priced inventory and must raise prices. Whilst West Africa producers wait for the next harvest in October, or years for new plantings to mature.
Valentines related stocks are not well-represented in the stock market
There are only a few chocolate-related stocks, and this has been shrinking after Mars bought Hotel Chocolat. With very few others directly exposed to Valentines trends. 1-800-Flowers.com (FLWS) is one of the few listed flower stocks but has a market cap under $1 billion and is guiding for near double-digit sales declines. Greeting cards is a similar story, with giants like Hallmark private and those in public markets, like the UKs Moonpig (MOONM.L), small and suffering since its 2021 IPO.

Investors await more clues on the timing of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed).Indeed, the market believes the Fed won't deliver its first rate cut in March, while the probability of a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut in May is just around 54%. Thus, traders generally expect the macroeconomic environment in the US to remain supportive of tight monetary policy. Traders believe the US will continue to perform well, with inflation easing. Therefore, any data release challenging this view will cause a strong market reaction. For example, if January's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) comes out lower than expected tomorrow,
XAU/USD
will likely rally sharply.XAU/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Thomas Barkin, Richmond Fed president, will give a speech at 5:00 p.m. UTC today. It might impact the price of gold, especially if he clearly indicates the future path of US interest rates. Other than that, the formal macroeconomic calendar is uneventful, so XAU/USD may continue to trade sideways with a minor bearish tilt.The
euro
(EUR) gained 0.06% on Friday after the US Labour Department revised its December inflation data, showing a smaller increase in prices than expected.The annual revisions published by the US Labour Department on Friday showed that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased slightly less than reported in December. The data triggered a minor sell-off in the

Fabio Panetta, the ECB Governing Council member, said that the moment was fast approaching for the central bank to cut interest rates. Indeed, the market now expects more rate cuts from the ECB than from the Fed this year. This relative divergence in expectations should put downward pressure on EUR/USD.EUR/USD continued to rise during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today's macroeconomic calendar doesn't have important economic releases, so already-established trends may continue. However, traders might prefer to close their active positions before tomorrow's US CPI report. Furthermore, EUR/USD is approaching strong resistance in the 1.08000 area, and some bulls might close their long positions.

(BTC) consolidated above 48,000 yesterday, ending the week with a 13.50% increase.At the beginning of February, Bitcoin lacked any significant price movements, demonstrating uncertainty among traders. However, the influx of investments into Spot Bitcoin ETFs increased demand for the asset, and
BTC/USD
broke above the 48,000 level for the first time since December 2021. Within the initial 20 days of operation, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have rapidly accumulated an impressive $10 billion in assets under management, demonstrating investors' enthusiasm for a new investment approach.American investment management firm ARK Invest, notably optimistic about Bitcoin, predicts BTC will replace gold as a safe-haven asset. Thus, the cryptocurrency may continue rising as it becomes an important part of financial markets. ARK Invest argues that Bitcoin's resilience to economic shocks, such as interest rate hikes and inflation, positions it favorably in the current economic landscape. The US Securities and Exchange Commission's recent approval of the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a crucial event for the market. This progress reflects Bitcoin's growing acceptance among institutional investors and suggests a shift in its recognition as a valuable asset.Today, BTC/USD failed to consolidate above 48,500 in the Asian trading session and dropped to around 48,000. An important event for Bitcoin is the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on 13 February at 1:30 p.m. UTC. This event may determine whether BTC/USD can surpass its previous high of 49,000, established on 11 January. Lower-than-expected CPI figures may push BTC/USD higher.

Investing.com,"S&P 500 Rally Continues Despite Rate Jitters, US Dollar Strength",2024-02-12,0.666667,"Last Fridays inflation revisions in the US were insignificant and hinted that inflation in the US was about the same by the end of last year. Consumer prices rose 3.3% in the final 3 months of the year in the US  the latter was good news for everyone craving to see the Federal Reserve (Fed) eventually start cutting interest rates sometime in the H1 of this year. But alas, the
US 2-year yield
 which best reacts to the rate expectations  rose on Friday and is gently drilling above the October-to-now descending channels top, and the
10-year yield
is back flirting with the 4.20% level despite strong bond auctions of last week in the US. Activity on Fed funds futures gives less than a 20% chance for the first rate cut in March, while the probability of a May cut has fallen to around 63%, from above 90% before the blockbuster jobs report released for January.In theory, when yields go down, equity valuations go up. But the
S&P 500
valuations  which are heavily influenced by the Big Technology stocks - have decoupled from the yields a few weeks ago. The 2-year yield bottomed by mid-January on realization that the Fed cut expectations had gone ahead of themselves, but the S&P 500 kept running from record to record and rose for the 14th
week over the past 15 weeks  a thing that has not happened since 1972, apparently. The index closed last week above the 5000 psychological mark.
Nasdaq 100
, on the other hand, recorded its 11th ATH this year. The strong economic data from the US that keeps defying the theory that the economy should slow when you hike rates, the strong earnings from big US companies (especially the tech companies that continue to surf on the AI optimism), and the slowing inflation are the major drivers of the optimism. The decoupling is also valid from the small-cap stocks. But the more the S&P 500 stocks extend their gains to fresh highs, the more it becomes difficult to find new buyers, as many investors are already on board, perhaps waiting for a dip to extend their position, in a market that forgot the formation of a dip.On the other hand, the CFTC data shows that the net speculative positions are building against the S&P 500. It could mean two things. One: there is an increasing number of investors betting for a correction at the current levels. And two: if correction doesnt come, these bets against the S&P 500 could turn around and help the S&P 500 extend gains. The more reasonable scenario is a correction  but hey, the rally could stretch as long as investors are willing to buy.This week, the attention will be on the latest CPI updates. The headline inflation is expected to fall below 3% from 3.4% printed a month earlier and core inflation is seen easing from 3.9% to 3.8%. If there are no major surprises in these inflation figures, there is no reason to think that the Fed will spoil the market mood. If thats the case, the US dollar should continue to see resistance near its 100-DMA and allow its peers to regain some field. The
EUR/USD
could retest its 200-DMA, that stands near 1.0830, the
yen
could remain offered into the 150 level, and Cable consolidate above 1.26 until Wednesdays inflation data in Britain. Remember, inflation in Britain had surprised to the upside in the latest meeting. The BoE reminded investors that their fight against inflation was not over just yet and some MPC members even voted to hike the rates at the latest meeting. So the market sees only 75bp cut this year from the Bank of England (BoE), less than half of what was expected at the beginning of this year.The positive trend of
crude oil
since the start of this year is becoming clearer, although the topside remains hard to drill near the $80pb level. Still, the barrel of US crude extended gains above the $77pb on Friday and is upbeat this morning  in a very slow Asian session with many Asian markets closed for Chinese New Year holiday. Israel refusing the ceasefire call from Hamas supported the latest upside move last week.This week, OPEC and IEA will release their monthly report on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Attention will be paid to how they will revise their demand outlook in reaction to global developments. On one hand, the strong US economy and Chinese stimulus measures are positive for the demand dynamics and should support oil prices beyond the geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, the significant retreat in global interest rate cut expectations weighs on global demand outlook. One thing is sure, OPEC will keep fighting to maintain oil prices sustained until the last drop. The problem is, Bidens US is pumping a record amount of oil to counterweigh the price increases that OPEC needs so badly."
Investing.com,Banks Begin Choking on Their Commercial Real Estate Exposure,2024-02-12,0.333333,"Last year  around April 
I wrote to you
about the mounting fragility in the commercial real estate sector. And specifically how exposed the smaller-medium banks were.High vacancy rates, declining rent prices, a glut of supply, and higher interest rates are all weighing on the sector and whoever financed them.But to give you some context, I wrote:Its important to remember that banks are
black boxes
 aka something with internals that are usually hidden or mysterious to onlookers.
Even the best analysts dont really know what bank loan books are truly worth. But one thing seems clear, the commercial real estate sector is growing more and more fragile. And with it, so are the smaller banks that extended credit to them.
The black swans are lurkingNow, I dont particularly like quoting myself.
But Its important for what I am about to share with you.And that is, the regional banking sector has been
rocked
after the
surprisingly
awful Q4-2023 earnings from
New York Community Bancorp (NYSE: NYSE:
NYCB
)
 sending the banks shares down roughly 50% (as of writing this) since January 30th, 2024.Some of you may remember this bank. It hadacquired $40 billion worth of assetsfrom the collapsed New York Signature Bank (OTC:
SBNY
) last year (one of the casualties after Silicon Valley Bank imploded).So, what led to this brutal sell-off of NYCB?A few things  but lets break down the key points:Thus, in summary, the pain stems largely from a weakening commercial real estate market that impelled NYCB to deal with mounting losses.Of course, as NYCB absorbed the former NY Signature Bank assets, it grew in size. Which requires the bank to have higher capital requirements (meaning they need to put more cash aside).They also announced the new appointment of Mr. Alessandro (Sandro) DiNello as Executive Chairman effective immediately on Wednesday.But changing leadership so suddenly usually does not help confidence. If anything, it increases uncertainty.And if theres one thing the market hates  its uncertainty.Meanwhile, NYCBs newly appointed executive chairmansaidon a conference call with analysts Wednesday that his company will do whats necessary to build capital (aka selling assets such as loans), and will reduce its commercial real estate concentration as quickly as it can.If we must shrink, then we will shrink,
Mr. DiNello said.
If we must sell nonstrategic assets, then well do that.It is particularly important to note that  in general  I believe banks have held back from selling bundles of mortgages to private lenders or hedge funds so far.Why? Because many of these long-term loans are underwater since rates surged.Remember, as rates go up, bond prices fall. Thus, courtesy of the Federal Reserves rate hikes over the last two years, banks still have a disgusting number of unrealized losses from investments  a staggering $700 billion worth as of Q3-2023.Thus, banks have pursued sales of shorter-dated debt such as auto loans off their books (which havent been impacted as much as longer-dated investments due to the rate hikes).But still, synthetic securitizations have started to make their way into the US market as banks search for ways to manage their capital constraints.Simply put, in a synthetic securitization, a bank buys credit protection on a portfolio of loans from an investor (like a hedge fund or pension fund or insurance firm). Thus, if a loan in the portfolio defaults, the investor reimburses the bank for the losses incurred on loans in that portfolio.Think of things like credit default swaps, credit guarantees, or other derivatives contracts to try and hedge losses (aka shift the risk around).Seems like a nice deal, right?Banks get to sell off risk to reduce their exposure to specific sectors and free up cash. Meanwhile, the buyers  mainly insurance companies and hedge funds  receive attractive spreads.Well, the problem is it just shifts the risk to a different hand. It doesnt remove it.And while this is an issue  theres another point Id like to highlightMy big worry here is that banks can try to shift the risks as much as theyd like, but if the underlying loans  particularly commercial real estate  begin defaulting or deteriorating, it could lead to investors shying away (who would want to catch a falling knife?).Thus, if commercial real estate woes continue (which I believe they will), it can begin affecting bank confidence.And as a bank, theres no worse problem than collapsing confidence.For instance, if customers begin seeing headlines that their main bank is selling assets to raise cash, facing increased loan defaults, etc.  they may begin pulling money out.Something like, Huh, thats troubling. The bank where I park all my savings just saw its share price plunge. Maybe I should move my deposits out.In essence, thats how a bank will often fail  because they cant sell assets quickly enough to raise cash for depositors wanting it out. Thus, they are forced to sell on the market at steep discounts.But heres where things get interestingThe deposits these banks rely on are flighty because more of them exceed the governments $250,000-per-account insurance limit  meaning these are deposits that surpass the $250,000 FDIC insurance.For example, if you had $1,000,000 in Bank A and it imploded, you would only get $250,000 back from FDIC alone. Potentially suffering a $750,000 loss.To emphasize the scale of this point, uninsured deposits  as of May 2023  are around 40% of all deposits (up from only 20% three decades ago). And these uninsured deposits are a lurking problem for banking stability  especially in an era of online banking (aka how fast money can be transferred around).As we saw last spring, uninsured deposits are the first to go, which can quickly leave banks insolvent.Making matters worse, banks plied such flighty (uninsured) deposits into illiquid loans  such as commercial real estate.Thus, any decline in confidence that would lead to individuals yanking their money out of banks would force them to sell such illiquid loans on the market  which would likely be at steep losses.As we saw from NYCBs latest results  the problem now is commercial real-estate debt  which is souring like milk sitting on a porch during an Arizona summer.And unfortunately, I do not believe banks shifting the risk around will help.Why? Because the landlords face higher interest rates than they can afford, tenants are cutting their leases, and landlords are struggling to raise rents as overcapacity weighs down margins.This jump in supply has left many landlords struggling to fill vacancies, motivating them to drop asking rents in some cases (aka more supply than demand).For instance, the median U.S. asking rent declined -2.1% year over year in November to $1,967the biggest annual drop since February 2020and fell -0.6% from October.This is great for would-be renters. But for commercial real estate investors, landlords, and banks  its not a great thing.Its always a double-edged sword, right?The point is  beware of any contagion effects from further issues in commercial real estate.Maybe NYCB was a one-off.But maybe it wasnt.As always, just some food for thought."
Investing.com,Federal Government Runs Another Deficit Despite Record Revenue,2024-02-13,0.333333,"By Mike Maharrey, Money Metals Exchange
The federal government's budget deficit was only $21.93 billion in January.
That was a significant improvement over the $129 billion shortfall recorded in December.
But dont throw the confetti.
The smaller deficit was primarily due to increased government receipts thanks to a big drop in tax refunds. But the Biden administration is still spending like a drunken sailor. (No disrespect to drunken sailors.)
Meanwhile, interest payments on the rapidly ballooning national debt continue to expand at breakneck speed.
Through the first four months of fiscal 2024, the federal government ran a $531.86 trillion deficit, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That is a 16 percent increase over the same period in fiscal 2023.
These massive monthly budget shortfalls are pushing the national debt higher at a dizzying pace. On December 29, the national debt eclipsed $34 trillion for the first time. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5, the national debt stood at a ""mere"" $31.46 trillion. As of Feb. 9, the national debt stood at $34.2 trillion.
According to the CBO, debt held by the public is projected to balloon from $26.2 trillion to $48.3 trillion by the end of 2034. That would represent 116 percent of GDP and would be the highest level on record.The federal government is a little like a drunk dude up late shopping on Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
).
The Treasury reported $477.32 billion in receipts last month, a January record. Collection of payroll and income tax withholdings helped boost government revenue. The IRS has also cleared a backlog of delayed income tax filings from the pandemic year.
But even with this revenue windfall, the U.S. government still ran a deficit. Thats because it is addicted to spending money.
In January, the U.S. Biden administration blew through $499.25 billion, also a January record.These big budget deficits are happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills, and it is likely one of the reasons that the Federal Reserve is talking about rate cuts. The borrow-and-spend U.S. government cant function in a high interest-rate environment.
The U.S. government spent $69.2 billion on interest expenses alone in January. This was more than the amount spent on national defense ($60 billion) and more than healthcare ($68 billion).
Interest on the federal debt came in $96 billion higher through the first four months of the fiscal year than in the same period last year. The government has shelled out $357 billion on interest payments in fiscal 2023. The only category with higher spending was Social Security.
Net interest expense, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, was $283 billion through the first four months of the fiscal year, still nearly as much as the government spent on national defense ($298 billion).
And interest expense will only continue to climb.
Much of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month, some of that super-low-yielding paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates.
The weighted average interest rate on the governments outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.21 percent as of the end of January. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.43 percent in January 2022.
Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words, the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
And it's only going to get worse unless the Fed quickly ratchets down interest rates.
Interest expense will continue to rise at a rapid rate as more and more Treasuries mature and are replaced by higher-yielding bonds.
The only way out of this fiscal death spiral is significant spending cuts and/or major tax hikes.
I wouldnt hold my breath.
And I would hold on to my confetti."
Investing.com,US CPI Preview,2024-02-13,0.333333,"The January US CPI report will be released at
8:30am ET on Tuesday, February 13, 2024.Traders and economists expect the US CPI report fall to
2.9% y/y
on a headline basis, with the Core (ex-food and -energy) reading anticipated at
3.8% y/y
.If these expectations are realized, it would mark the lowest year-over-year readings for the two measures in nearly three years.Heading into the year, there was a clear script that traders and economists were expecting the US economy to follow:Theres been just one problem with this: The economy didnt get the memo. Instead of following that script, weve seen blowout employment figures, inflation seemingly reaccelerating, and the Fed pushing back on expectations for interest rate cuts in March. Tomorrows US CPI report is the next big test to see if the nascent trend of US economic exceptionalism in 2024 continues.Digging into the data, headline CPI has clearly seen its decline stall over the last couple of quarters, with the year-over-year measure actually increasing from 3.0% to 3.4% over the last six months. That said, the Fed is more concerned with the Core CPI reading, which is seen as more indicative of underlying price pressures and has continued to edge lower in recent months.One of the best leading indicators for inflation is the Prices component of the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI surveys. Historically, a simple average of these two components has been a relatively reliable predictor of CPI readings 3-6 months into the future, as the chart below shows:Source: TradingView, StoneXWhile it wont necessarily impact CPI dramatically this month, the most recent round of PMI surveys showed prices increasing for 58.5% of respondents across the two surveys, suggesting that inflation could well tick up as we move into the Spring. This is no doubt a concern for the Fed and may lead to a smaller-than-expected reaction even if this weeks (lagging) CPI reading comes in below expectations.Notably,
traders are not necessarily expecting a massive move on the back of this months CPI report
. Measures of implied volatility in the FX market are hovering near 2-year lows amidst the ongoing Lunar New Year holiday, and according to Reuters, options traders are pricing in an average of a 38-pip move in
EUR/USD
and 58-pip move in
USD/JPY
ahead of the data. That said, with fewer traders at their desks than usual, theres certainly the potential for an outsized move if the data truly surprises relative to expectations.Source:
TradingView
, StoneXAs is often the case with US data, USD/JPY may have the cleanest, most logical reaction to this months CPI data. Looking at the chart above, USD/JPY is consolidating after its breakout above 148.70 resistance last week.For this week, the key resistance level to watch will be the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the November-December drop near 149.40. If bulls are able to overcome that resistance level (potentially on the back of a hotter-than-expected US CPI report), the pair has little in the way of technical resistance until closer to 152.00. Meanwhile, a soft inflation reading and bearish reaction in USD/JPY could take rates below previous-resistance-turned-support at 148.70, opening the door for a deeper retracement below 148.00.Original Post"
Investing.com,Markets seek direction from US CPI report,2024-02-13,0.444444,
Investing.com,"How the CPI Report May Impact Gold, British Pound",2024-02-13,0.333333,"The gold (XAU) price declined by 0.22% on Monday in a relatively quiet trading session as traders refrained from placing big orders ahead of today's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.Jim Wyckoff, the senior analyst at Kitco Metal, said that interest rate cuts would probably be pushed back to the second half of the year, as US economic data has been too strong lately to expect a rate cut by May. He also added that there is limited buying interest in gold due to the recent rally in the stock market. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chance of a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate cut in May is now less than 50%. High-interest rates exert bearish pressure on gold since the metal doesn't yield any passive income.XAU/USD
was essentially flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the most important event is the US CPI report at 1:30 p.m. UTC, which could offer insights into the Fed's plans for interest rates. A Reuters poll of economists projects a 0.2% monthly rise in January's CPI, while core figures are expected to increase by 0.3%. Figures exceeding these forecasts will almost certainly lower the probability of an interest rate cut this spring, potentially bringing XAU/USD below 2,000. Conversely, lower-than-expected CPI numbers will likely cause a rally in XAU/USD, possibly towards 2,050.The euro (EUR) lost 0.1% in a relatively volatile trading session on Monday, as the market participants repositioned ahead of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.EUR/USD
had been in an uptrend for the past week, but the bullish trend has recently weakened. Fundamentally, the eurozone economy appears weaker than the US, leading traders to price in more interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) than by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Thus, the fundamental pressure on EUR/USD should be bearish. However, the pair is highly sensitive to new data releases and officials' comments. For example, the decline in EUR/USD yesterday might have been partly due to dovish comments from ECB board member Piero Cipollone. He stated that the central bank doesn't need to create more slack in the eurozone economy to get inflation under control, given that demand is already weak. In other words, the ECB is increasingly seeking an opportunity to cut interest rates.EUR/USD was essentially flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions ahead of the US CPI report at 1:30 p.m. UTC. Lower-than-expected figures will increase the Fed's confidence in taking control over inflation. Thus, the data will likely lead to a sell-off in the
US dollar
, while EUR/USD might rally above 1.08000. If CPI figures exceed the forecast, EUR/USD can potentially drop below the important 1.07200 level.The British pound (GBP) gained 0.06% in a quiet trading session on Monday.GBP/USD
has been moving sideways for the past 4 days ahead of the release of the critical macroeconomic reports from the US and the U.K. This week is likely to be extremely volatile for GBP traders as inflation reports in both countries, together with other significant releases, will provide clues on when the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England (BOE) may begin cutting interest rates. Currently, the market views the BOE as a relatively less dovish regulator than the Fed. According to the interest rate swap market data, investors price in only 80 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts from the BOE but expect 110 bps worth of rate cuts from the Fed in 2024. This week's reports may substantially alter current expectations and define the GBP/USD trend in the medium term.GBP/USD was essentially unchanged in the Asian session today but jumped sharply during the early European trading hours following the release of a better-than-expected labor market report by the Office of National Statistics. The data showed that British wages, excluding bonuses, grew by 6.2% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, while the unemployment rate dropped to just 3.8%. If the US CPI figures at 1:30 p.m. UTC today are lower than expected, the bullish trend in GBP/USD might continue, potentially pushing the pair above 1.26600. However, higher-than-expected CPI figures may break the bullish trend in GBP/USD, bringing the pair below 1.26000."
Investing.com,USD/JPY Set To Drop Further If Inflation Softens,2024-03-12,0.666667,"In the latest financial news, the focus is on the U.S. dollar's performance ahead of the eagerly anticipated release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has significant implications for future monetary policy decisions. This data release is a critical moment for markets, as it can influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. A CPI reading below the anticipated 3.1% could signal weaker inflation pressures, potentially leading to speculations about the Federal Reserve lowering rates in the future. Conversely, a figure exceeding 3.1% might prompt a short-term rally in the dollar as it suggests continuing inflation concerns, possibly deterring immediate rate cuts.
Additionally, the intraday price structure of the dollar reveals potential for fluctuation, guided by the Elliott wave analysis which hints at an ongoing impulsive drop in the USD, with a rally in wave four currently searching for resistance near the 103.00 level. Should this pattern lead to a subsequent drop, it may position the
USD/JPY
pair as a significant mover, especially in light of speculative shifts between a hawkish Bank of Japan (BOJ) and a potentially dovish Federal Reserve stance.
Today's CPI data release, set for 13:30 CET, is thus highly anticipated, with market participants closely monitoring for impacts on yield volatility and future Fed rate adjustments.

Investing.com,"Ponzi Economy, 2024",2024-03-05,0.222222,"Though the economy is stable and markets are bullish by definition of price trends, the underpinning is anything but healthy.Of course, increasing debt leverage has been the game for decades now. Taking a stance against this leveraged and massive debt monster may have been right in theory and in essence, but would have been wrong in actual results, save for a few meltdowns over the last 2.4 decades of the worst (or some would say
best
) of it.The debt has increased markedly during a time when the Fed is supposedly tightening monetary policy. The government (fiscal) is spending like a drunken sailor with Treas/Sec Janet Yellen, who I assume has a direct line to the outwardly hawkish Jerome Powell, right in there overseeing the process.TheNFTRHview is that in an important, divisive and downright scary presidential election year (in its lack of viable choices) the Fed is keeping up hawkish appearances with the Funds Rate, but relieving that pressure out its backside orifice through bond monetization activities (as per previous reports/graphs/data). My assumption is that it is doing this in coordination with the Biden admin, with Yellen as its point man.My further assumption is that this is an all or nothing play, a last chance power drive if you will, to secure the election by the Biden admin. Further still, my assumption is that
IF
they are able to keep up (debt-fueled) appearances into the election, what comes after is not going to be pretty. Quite the contrary, it will probably be very ugly indeed if/when 4 more years are secured.Why do I say that now, at $34 Trillion in debt as opposed to some other time at less Trillions in debt? I say it because at some point there will be a saturation point, when the edifice stops growing and just wheezes, rolls over and deflates. I say it becausefor the first time through those inflationary decades (for our purposes looking back to the 2000 time frame, but in the Continuums trend, back to the 1980s) something broke, finally!I do not make a habit of getting hysterical about things such as irreconcilable debt because decades lined up one after the other are a long time. It was proven to me many years ago that they can keep the game going longer than any given idealist can maintain a positive mental health situation while opposing it. You can be fundamentally pure and lead a hell of a lot of people astray. However, while not being hysterical at the current time, I sure as shootin will highlight reasoning why it may be different this time, finally.The Continuum chart was created many years ago to advise the intact downtrend in long-term Treasury yields. As noted many times, my view is that the downtrend  and its disinflationary signaling  allowed and enabled monetary policymakers (Fed) to promote inflationary operations at will. Why not inflate? The Bond market says no inflation problem! Well, in 2022 with the break of the decades old trend, the bond market said inflation problem!Fast forward to 2024 and we see the government doing all it can to leverage more and more Trillions in debt for economic stability while the Fed plays hawk while also manipulating bonds to assure it does not
play hawk
too aggressively. Wouldnt want to ruin good election year stock mania, now would we?While I am of course only making guesses educated by indicators, I think it is a viable plan to expect them to try to keep things intact into the election, after which we will see a deflationary resolution. The other possibility is that the newly reaffirmed government (Biden admin) will just keep on fiscally pumping. But the second term imperative will be something less, dont you think? If they grab power for 4 more years thats a win. After that, Katie bar the door. All bets are off.I am trying my best to just illustrate what the markets indications are telling me. You may recall that I was critical of Trump. I still am. I wish there were another viable candidate to stand against the democrat machine. But the republicans are a mess, with a spectacular (one definition: strikingly large or obvious) figure at the head. I would also add the description cartoon-like. But what the party in power is doing is in my opinion mortgaging us all (we Americans, anyway) in order to keep power beyond 2024.As such, the NFTRH plan is for this high risk process to continue as long as that risk is not realized. Its a one-way ticket to paradise and a last chance power drive. It is dangerous, desperate and
bullish
. When my original rally projections of Q1-Q2, 2023 morphed into year-end I had this thought: duh, its an election year and duh its the most divisive election year maybe ever. Markets are getting manic to the upside and the question remains can they bring it to the finish line in November?"
Investing.com,Key Indicator Signals Recession Ahead  Fed Faces Pressure to Cut Rates,2024-03-04,0.333333,"By Stefan Gleason, Money Metals Exchange
The mainstream financial media is reporting that inflation is coming down.
Its not coming down to the Federal Reserves supposed 2% target  let alone low enough to cease being a persistent problem for millions of families. Nor is it even clear that the rate of price level increases is on a path lower in 2024.
According to William J. Luther of the American Institute for Economic Research:The PCEPI has grown at an annualized rate of 1.8 percent over the last three months and 2.5 percent over the last six months. Prices today are 8.4 percentage points higher than they would have been had they grown at an annualized rate of 2.0 percent since January 2020.
Some categories of consumer prices are up much more than the overall official reading (which has been engineered by federal bureaucrats to understate food, shelter, healthcare and other expenses).
For example, food stamp costs for family meals have jumped more than 30% over the past three years. Automobile insurance rates are up 26%. And rising housing costs continue to outpace income growth.
To the extent that consumer price increases do ease at all this year, it will be because the economy is slowing.
The latest manufacturing data releases suggest the industrial sector is seeing softening demand. States are starting to report rising levels of job losses. And consumers are growing more negative toward the economy.
The Conference Board reported last week that consumer confidence fell in February for the first time in three months. Americans expectations for income and business conditions saw a significant decline, falling below a threshold that often signals recession ahead, according to the Conference Board.
Contrary to how ordinary Americans are feeling about the economy, the Biden administration is trying to sell them the narrative that its gotten far better since he assumed office.
But judging by Joe Bidens historically low approval rating, that narrative isnt resonating with many voters.
The upshot is that pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates will likely grow between now and November.
When central bankers finally do relent and begin easing, the U.S. dollar can be expected to weaken in the currency market. That could be the catalyst precious metals markets need to move meaningfully higher."
Investing.com,"EUR/USD Trying to Stabilize Ahead of ECB, NFPs",2024-03-04,0.666667,"The USD experienced a decline on Friday following the release of the US Manufacturing PMI, a key indicator of economic health, which came in at 47.8, below the expected 49.5. This lower figure could potentially ease inflationary pressures, bringing the market closer to anticipating a rate cut by the Fed. Additionally, earlier in the week, the US Core PCE Price Index met expectations, registering at 2.8%, albeit down from the previous reading of 2.9%. This prompts speculation regarding when the Fed might decide to take action, or how long it will maintain current interest rates. More insight may be gained following the release of the US ISM Services PMI tomorrow and the US NFP report on Friday. Moreover, this week also features the ECB rate decision, with members displaying a more hawkish stance. This raises questions about whether the
EURUSD
pair could witness further upward movement. Presently, there are indications of a modest recovery on an intraday basis, with bunds also showing signs of stabilization. Consequently, I am considering the possibility of further upside for the EURUSD pair, while the dollar could continue its intraday decline amid a risk-on environment."

Investing.com,Natural Gas,2024-02-20,0.666667,"In 2024, the U.S. gas market remains highly volatile. Since January 13, the price of gas has fallen by more than 40% to $1.6 for an MMBTU.But why is this happening, and what affects the price of gas?Previously, the number of drilling rigs in operation was crucial, and the price of gas strongly correlated with this figure and production volumes. However, today, the correlation between output and the number of rigs has practically become insignificant.The consumption structure states that the primary sales market is the United States itself, so this price chart is mainly explained by the weather in this country. The weather conditions vary, and gas consumption is peaking in winter and summer. For example, in summer, the central heights of consumption occur in July and August, and by the winter months, they increase by 1.5 times.
Dynamics of
natural gas
pricesSource: Investing.com
The problem with the weather is that the temperature can drop sharply in a very short period. Then, the maximum extraction of gas from storage facilities should begin. Respectively, gas spot prices increase. And when the weather gets better, the price drops.
Starting in spring and until the end of October, approximately 10% of production goes to underground gas storage facilities (UGS). This helps the country to survive the winter, as gas consumption for heating can increase five times in three days. Of course, it is impossible to increase production volumes so quickly, so reserves from storage cover the deficit. Another reason for the decline is the slowdown in exports due to the cold weather. In this case, there is an oversupply of gas in the domestic market, and the spot price decreases significantly.Fundamental changes in gas production, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, have allowed the United States to almost double its output since 2009 by 2023. The United States is the world's leading natural gas producer, although its proven reserves account for only a third of Russia's reserves. In 2022, gross natural gas production in the United States amounted to 43,802,269 million cubic feet.
The increase in gas production made it possible to begin the global restructuring of all energy capacities and embark on the path of green transformation. The United States is actively involved in decarbonization and developing renewable energy (wind and solar). Additionally, coal plants are being re-equipped or closed.
In parallel with the increase in production, gas transportation through US gas pipelines developed. This can be traced by the price difference at intermediate hubs, for example, Waha Hub and Henry Hub. Previously, prices reached a difference of 10 times, but over some periods this spread narrowed. In the next two years, it is expected that prices will draw together.
Moreover, the export shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) began in 2015 and increased in seven years from 28,381 million cubic feet in 2015 to 3,865,643 in 2022.As mentioned above, gas production is increasing. Industrial gas consumption is also growing. But paradoxically, there is no increase in the number of underground gas storage facilities introduced. There is an economic explanation for this.
Between 2009 and 2022, the drilling rate increased fivefold. The area's geological study has expanded, allowing for accurate well modeling. The length of the horizontal trunk has also improved, and the grid of wells has been brought to an optimal one. Moreover, the productivity of the equipment has increased, and the cost of this equipment has also decreased. As a result, the cost of well construction was halved, and productivity multiplied by ten. Therefore, the correlation between production and the number of drilling rigs has ceased to be significant.
According to my estimates, with a sharp decrease in exports, the gas price will decrease to $1.5 - 1.8 for an MMBTU. Such a price will stop the introduction of new wells and drilling. Accordingly, without introducing wells, there will be a decrease in production for the month and price stabilization. The excess gas will be pumped into the UGS within a month, corresponding to peak daily injections into storage facilities. According to regulatory requirements, peak injection can be kept for a month, and during this time, production will decrease. Subsequently, despite the current drop, we can expect the average gas price in 2024 in the USA at $2.6 - 2.8.Today, the United States is undergoing a transition to a new technological order. Robots perform technological operations, and they are controlled using artificial intelligence based on clean energy. Despite digitalization, human capital remains a priority. The United States continues to focus on developing intelligence, attracting the best minds from around the world.
There is a question of finding raw materials for producing new high-tech goods. In this context, the United States is increasingly using chemical compounds based on hydrocarbons, replacing metal and cotton products with them. In addition, the country is actively promoting a zero-liquid discharge policy, seeking to involve more and more human waste products and recyclables in secondary circulation."
Investing.com,Fed Bank Bailout Program Ends in March...Then What?,2024-02-16,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey, Money Metals Exchange
The bank bailout program established by the Federal Reserve in the wake of last spring's banking crisis is scheduled to shut down on March 11.
Then what?
There are a lot more questions than answers.
For instance, will the Fed blink?
And if it doesnt, how will the end of the bailout ripple through the financial system?
The Federal Reserve created the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank (OTC:
SBNY
) last March, allowing banks to easily access cash to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors.""
As one would expect, the balance in the program surged initially as banks tapped into the bailout. But borrowing never stopped. As you can see from the chart, borrowing leveled off in August before the sudden spike in November. Keep in mind that banks were still tapping into the bailout even as the total balance in the program plateaued. Some banks were paying off loans as others borrowed.The BTFP was a sweetheart deal for cash-strapped banks struggling to cope with crashing bond portfolios as interest rates rose.
Through this lending facility, banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions can take out short-term loans (up to one year) using U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral.
Thats where the sweetheart deal comes in. Instead of valuing these collateral assets at their market value, banks can borrow against them at par (Face value).
When the Fed started raising interest rates, bond prices dropped precipitously (Bond yields and bond prices are inversely correlated.) As bond prices fell, the value of bank asset portfolios crashed along with them. Typically, the amount banks can borrow is based on the current market value of their bond portfolios. As bonds tanked their borrowing ability shrank. But by valuing collateral at par, the Fed allowed banks to borrow as if the value of the assets never dropped. Simply put, the BTFP allows banks to borrow more than they otherwise could.
Imagine if there was a tornado in your area that damaged your house. The home would suddenly be worth a lot less than it was before the storm, right? Now imagine going to the bank and asking for a second mortgage based on the value of your home before the tornado. Do you think that bank would make that loan?
Of course not.
The bank probably wouldnt loan you money based on the lower value of your storm-damaged house, much less on what your home was worth before the tornado. Banks simply dont accept collateral that is worth less than the amount of the loan.
That is unless youre a bank in trouble.
The problems at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) that led to its demise reveal the reason for the bailout.
SVB went under because it tried to sell undervalued bonds to raise cash. The plan was to sell the longer-term, lower-interest-rate bonds and reinvest the money into shorter-duration bonds with a higher yield. Instead, the sale dented the banks balance sheet with a $1.8 billion loss driving worried depositors to pull funds out of the bank.
The BTFP gave banks an alternative. They could quickly raise capital against their bond portfolios without realizing big losses in an outright sale. It gives banks a way out, or at least the opportunity to kick the can down the road for a year.
In effect, the bailout papered over significant problems in the banking system.That remains unclear what will happen when the BTFP locks its doors on March 11.
In the first week of the BTFP, banks borrowed $11.9 billion from the program, along with more than $300 billion from the already-established Fed Discount Window. By April 5, the balance in the BTFP rose to just over $79 billion. By June, banks had borrowed around $100 billion. Borrowing plateaued before taking off again in November.
Troubled banks almost certainly accounted for the bulk of the borrowing in the early months of the bailout. Those early loans will start coming due in March. (Banks had one year from the loan date to repay.)
There are several unanswered questions. Have these banks improved their financial position since getting bailed out? Do they have the cash to pay back the loans? Will the end of the BTFP force them to liquidate their devalued bonds like SVB did?
If banks didnt address their underlying problems over the last year, we may well see more small and regional banks go under in the coming months.
And If that happens, will the Fed blink and reopen the BTFP?
This is something to keep our eyes on."
Investing.com,"Bitcoin, Gold as Speculative Warnings",2024-03-12,0.666667,"Over the last few years, digital currencies and
gold
have become decent barometers of speculative investor appetite. Such isnt surprising given the evolution of the market into a
casino
following the pandemic, where
retail traders have increased their speculative appetites
.That enthusiasm has increased sharply since last November as stocks surged in hopes that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates. As noted by Sentiment Trader:That frenzy to chase the markets, driven by the psychological bias of the
fear of missing out,
has permeated the entirety of the market. As noted in
this article
:Of course, it is not just a speculative frenzy in the markets for stocks, specifically anything related to
artificial intelligence,
but that exuberance has spilled over into gold and cryptocurrencies.There are a couple of ways to measure exuberance in the assets. While sentiment measures examine the broad market, technical indicators can reflect exuberance on individual asset levels. However, before we get to our charts, we need a brief explanation of statistics, specifically, standard deviation.As I discussed in
Revisiting Bob Farrells 10 Investing Rules:The idea of
stretching the rubber band
can be measured in several ways, but I will limit our discussion this week to
Standard Deviation
and measuring deviation with
Bollinger Bands.Standard Deviation
is defined as:In plain English,
this means
that the further away from the average that an event occurs, the more unlikely it becomes.As shown below, out of 1000 occurrences, only three will fall outside the area of
3 standard deviations
. 95.4% of the time, events will occur within two standard deviations.A second measure of
exuberance
is
relative strength.With those two measures, lets look at Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
), the poster child of speculative momentum trading in the markets. Nvidia trades more than 3 standard deviations above its moving average, and its RSI is 81.The last time this occurred was in July of 2023 when Nvidia consolidated and corrected prices through November.Interestingly, gold also trades well into 3 standard deviation territory with an RSI reading of 75. Given that gold is supposed to be a
safe haven
or
risk off
asset, it is instead getting swept up in the current market exuberance.The same is seen with digital currencies. Given the recent approval of spot,
Bitcoin
exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the panic bid to buy Bitcoin has pushed the price well into 3 standard deviation territory with an RSI of 73.In other words, the stock market frenzy to
buy anything that is going up
has spread from just a handful of stocks related to artificial intelligence to gold and digital currencies.We can see the correlation between stock market exuberance and gold and digital currency, which has risen since 2015 but accelerated following the post-pandemic, stimulus-fueled market frenzy. Since the market, gold and cryptocurrencies, or Bitcoin for our purposes, have disparate prices, we have rebased the performance to 100 in 2015.Gold was supposed to be an inflation hedge. Yet, in 2022, gold prices fell as the market declined and inflation surged to 9%. However, as inflation has fallen and the stock market surged, so has gold.Notably, since 2015, gold and the market have moved in a more correlated pattern, which has reduced the hedging effect of gold in portfolios. In other words, during the subsequent market decline, gold will likely track stocks lower, failing to provide its 
wealth preservation
status for investors.The same goes for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is substantially more volatile than gold and tends to ebb and flow with the overall market. As sentiment surges in the
S&P 500
, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies follow suit as speculative appetites increase.Unfortunately, for individuals once again piling into Bitcoin to chase rising prices, if, or when, the market corrects, the decline in cryptocurrencies will likely substantially outpace the decline in market-based equities. This is particularly the case as Wall Street can now short the spot-Bitcoin ETFs, creating additional selling pressure on Bitcoin.Just for added measure, here is Bitcoin versus gold.There are many narratives surrounding the markets, digital currency, and gold. However, in todays market, more than in previous years, all assets are getting swept up into the investor-feeding frenzy.Sure, this time could be different. I am only making an observation and not an investment recommendation.However, from a portfolio management perspective, it will likely pay to remain attentive to the correlated risk between asset classes. If some event causes a reversal in bullish exuberance, cash and bonds may be the only place to hide."
Investing.com,Investor Sentiment Getting Greedy? Seems Unwarranted,2024-03-08,0.555556,"Several indicators of investor sentiment are showing rising greed levels. And when investors get greedy, it tends to imply that we are nearing a top.But, I am unsure why greed levels are so high when so many assets have
little to brag about over the past few years!Todays weekly chart mash-up shows the performance of 6 different instruments across various asset classes since December 2021 and
gold
has been the best performer at +13%.The others have literally gone nowhere. Basically flat.So perhaps all this excitement is a bit overdone. And maybe investors need to be more selective in choosing assets with good risk/reward setups."
Investing.com,Credit Spreads Signal Easing Financial Conditions,2024-03-06,0.333333,"Stocks fell sharply yesterday, ahead of Jay Powells
testimony
today. It would be great if Powell acknowledged how much financial conditions have eased and that easing conditions could undermine the Fed policy path and, more critically, delay future rate cuts.It would undoubtedly make yesterdays price action in risk assets seem tame. Because the rally in risk-assets certainly puts the Feds objective for inflation at risk. Lets face facts: rising asset prices are inflation.Credit spreads have melted lower following the December FOMC meeting. Given how much spreads have contracted, youd think the Fed had already cut rates.This is probably why there is no need for the Fed to cut rates at this point. The more credit spreads the easier financial conditions get.Maybe the stock market got a bit worried and thought if it went down a little the day before Powell was due to speak, he might take it a little easier.Maybe he will; I have no clue what he will say. But if Atlanta Feds Bostic is a guide, Powell may be talking about the potential to cut rates later this year, in slow and methodical pace, if the data allows it.What seems surprising to me is that there are still people on TV who think the Fed will cut rates 6 to 7 times this year.Im not sure what planet they are living on, but if
GDP
is still growing at a nominal rate of about 5%, and the Fed is struggling to get inflation back to 2%, why should the Fed cut at all?In the meantime,
Bitcoin
created a mere 9% bearish engulfing pattern on the day, I cant say I have ever seen something that impressive.Stuff like this is probably a good reason why Bitcoin will never have any place as a real currency in the world.Also, the
S&P 500
fell by around 1% on the day and managed to bounce right off the 5,060 level, which has held now several times and is a level not breached since Nvidias results back on February 22.Speaking of Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
), it managed to rise 1.5% in the last 30 minutes of trading to finish up on the day.Finally, we have just a few more days until the Bank Term Funding Program is retired. The program allowed banks to use the Treasury as collateral at par with the Fed in exchange for cash for one year.So between now and sometime around April 5, I imagine we see the balances in the program shrink by around $80 billion, while the rest remains until the 1st anniversary date.I guess that we should see reserves shrink by that $80 billion and the Fed Balance sheet shrink once the unwind begins.Some people have speculated that stocks have risen because of this program, but I am a bit more skeptical. I dont see how $160 billion in expanded reserve balances translates into a $10 trillion increase in the S&P 500 market cap.I certainly would hope there is not that much leverage deployed. When looking at the comparisons of the charts, I can see why someone might think that way.I guess we will only find out if the market starts to drop like it rose. If that happens, perhaps that little program the Fed created had much more impact than I thought.Original Post"

Investing.com,PCE Report Puts Rally to Test as Nasdaq 100 Hovers Above Key Support,2024-02-29,0.666667,"Stocks finished the day lower but managed to hold onto support, and it seems to suggest that today we are likely to see some kind of move.Which direction is tough to say, especially with the
PCE
report coming in the morning. Estimates are for
PCE
to rise by 0.3%, up from 0.2% last month, and rise by 2.4% y/y, down from 2.6% last month.The
core PCE
is expected to rise by 0.4% m/m, up from 0.2% and by 2.8% y/y, down from 2.9%.Again, I have no real view here because sell-side analysts have already gone through and parsed all of the data from the
CPI
and
PPI
and factored that into their estimates.But it would seem like analysts estimates for core PCE and PCE y/y have been pretty much in line with expectations for the past couple of months, or slightly too high.Regardless of the PCE report, inflation expectations are rising, and the 2-year breakeven yesterday climbed to 2.77%; I would be curious to see if it makes it back to the 3% mark or not.That was an important spot in the past, and it is likely to serve as an important spot should it get there in the future.Also of note yesterday was that the Dallas Fed President, Lorie Logan, commented that tapering the pace of QT isnt the same as stopping QT.The article quoted her as saying:So it only took since the beginning of January for this to be discussed again, but I guess its better late than never. Was this a sign that the Fed is starting to get uncomfortable with all the easing of financial conditions we have seen since November?Will the Fed have to start walking back the timing and the number of rate cuts below 3, next?I do not know, but I guess that we may be about to find out. If the current trends persist and the market is right, then inflation will not go anywhere but higher, and
oil
has not even broken out yet.Oil tried to break out yesterday but didnt hold those gains and instead closed back below resistance.Meanwhile, the
NASDAQ 100
managed to close right on support yesterday, at 17,850, and I guess we will find out if that support holds today.It appears to be a descending triangle; my understanding is that descending triangles typically are bearish and result in lower prices. I think that the gap at 17,480 is screaming to be filled.Anyway, another day, another stock is moving by some bizarre amount after hours. yesterday, it is Snowflakes (NYSE:
SNOW
) turn after it
provided
weaker-than-expected product revenue for the first quarter.So the stock is down, oh, about 24%. I really cant remember a time when we have seen moves of this magnitude regularly and of this size. SNOW isnt precisely a penny stock with a market cap of about $75 billion.YouTube Video:See you today.Original Post"
Investing.com,"Bonds Whisper Caution as Stocks Stall, US Dollar Rises Ahead of PCE Data",2024-02-28,0.555556,"Stocks were flat again yesterday as the events the rest of the week get a bit more interesting, with
GDP
revisions today,
PCE
on Thursday, and
ISM
on Friday.It seems clear that bond rates are waiting patiently for a signal or a reason to go higher. At this point, it seems like the
10-year
will be heading sharply higher and potentially back to 5% or below 4%. However, I think 5% is more likely.There is a lot of evidence to support the idea that rates go higher from here,
oil
being one of them.Right now, oil is butting up against resistance at $79, and this is the fourth time oil has hit this level since the end of January. A break out could send oil back to the mid to upper $80s.Gasoline is another reason to think that rates go higher because gasoline appears to be heading higher based on its technicals.The Atlanta Fed GDPNow model suggests that nominal growth in the first quarter will be around 6%, suggesting that rates go higher.I would think then that the
dollar
would also move higher, with the
DXY index
pushing back to the 106 area.The economic data and the fact that inflation is stuck around 3% will likely force the market to tighten financial conditions again.Conditions will have to tighten because why should investors get paid a rate of interest that is insufficient given the growth and inflation outlook of the economy?If the economy remains strong and rates rise, why shouldnt the dollar appreciate?If rates and the dollar appreciate, financial conditions will have to tighten unless high-yield investors accept smaller and smaller discounts on the added risk they have to take.The corporate bond advance-decline line has already turned lower, likely because rates have turned higher, another divergence signal between stocks and just about everything else.But we can see what happens.

Investing.com,"Despite June Easing Bets, There Is Growing Risk We Wont See Rate Cuts Until 2025",2024-03-13,0.333333,"Dont expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates anytime soon as sticky inflation seems to be very much intact at this point.Tuesdays much-anticipated U.S. February consumer price index (
CPI
) inflation report came in hotter than expected for the second straight month, providing further evidence that the Fed will be in no rush to start easing monetary policy.Source: Investing.comThe
CPI
rose 0.4% last month, marking the largest monthly increase since September. In the 12 months through February, the annual CPI increased 3.2%. That followed a gain of 3.1% in January.While CPI has come down significantly from a 40-year high of 9.1%, the data confirmed that the decline in inflation that began in the summer of 2022 has all but stalled.Source: Investing.comIn fact, taking a closer look at the chart above reveals that the headline figure has been stuck in a range between 3.0% and 3.8% for the past eight months, highlighting the challenge faced by the Fed in the last mile of its fight against rising prices.The last mile, which is often the hardest to bring under control
,
refers to the final 1% or 2% of excess inflation that the Fed needs to overcome to meet its 2% target.Excluding the volatile food and energy components,
core CPI
climbed 0.4% over the prior month and 3.8%
over last year
. The forecast had been for 0.3% and 3.7%, respectively.Furthermore, core services inflation excluding rents, a metric to which Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said he pays close attention, advanced 0.5% in February, and over the past three months is up on an annualized basis by 6.8%, compared with the 6.7% pace in January.The sticky-hot readings will add to Fed caution on the inflation outlook and suggest that FOMC officials would need to see further progress before they are comfortable cutting interest rates.The Feds inflation battle is far from over, with CPI still rising far more quickly than what the Fed would consider consistent with its 2% target range.Additionally, core inflation is proving stickier than expected and is anticipated to remain well above the Feds target for the foreseeable future.Indeed, this last mile of getting inflation down from 3% to 2% is going to be difficult - much harder than bringing it down from 9% to 3%.Source: Investing.comTaking that into consideration, the Fed will be in no rush to lower its key policy rate in my opinion despite market expectations for a June rate cut.Based on Investing.coms
Fed Monitor Tool
, investors are betting the Fed will reduce borrowing costs by about 75 basis points by year-end, delivering three-quarter percentage points of easing in June, September, and December.But that scenario is probably unrealistic amid the current macroeconomic backdrop.Contrary to the consensus view, I believe there is a growing risk that the Fed will hold off on cutting rates altogether this year as inflation takes longer to return to the Fed's target than many had hoped, and the economy keeps outperforming expectations.As such, the central bank is likely to keep interest rates at current levels for longer than investors expect amid sticky inflation, a resilient labor market, and solid consumer spending.Well find out more about the Feds rate plans next week.The U.S. central bank is widely expected to leave its benchmark Fed funds rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range where it has been since last July.Perhaps of greater importance, FOMC policymakers will also release updated interest rate projections as part of a so-called dot plot.At this point, it will be prudent to wonder how many cuts were ultimately going to get this year, if at all.Be sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.Readers of this article enjoy an extra 10% discount on the yearly and bi-yearly plans with the coupon codes

Investing.com,Billionaires on Average? US Consumption Struggles to Keep Up With Market Demand,2024-03-13,0.333333,"Social media users claiming to be Bougie Broke share pictures of their fancy cars, high-fashion clothing, and selfies in exotic locations and expensive restaurants. Yet they complain about living paycheck to paycheck and lacking the means to support their lifestyle.Bougie broke is like 
keeping up with the Joneses,
 spending beyond ones means to impress others.Bougie Broke gives us a glimpse into the financial condition of a growing number of consumers. Since personal consumption represents about two-thirds of economic activity, its worth diving into the Bougie Broke fad to appreciate if a large subset of the population can continue to consume at current rates.Forecasting personal consumption is always tricky, but it has become even more challenging in the post-pandemic era. To appreciate why we share a joke told by Mike Green.Bill Gates and I walk into the barBartender: Wow, a couple of billionaires on average!Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and other billionaires make us all much richer, on average. Unfortunately, we cant use the average to pay our bills.According to Wikipedia, Bill Gates is one of 756 billionaires living in the United States. Many of these billionaires became much wealthier due to the pandemic as their investment fortunes proliferated.To appreciate the wealth divide, consider the graph below courtesy of Statista. 1% of the U.S. population holds 30% of the wealth. The wealthiest 10% of households have two-thirds of the wealth.
The bottom
half of the population accounts for less than 3% of the wealth.The uber-wealthy grossly distorts consumption and savings data. And, with the sharp increase in their wealth over the past few years, the consumption and savings data are more distorted.Furthermore, and critical to appreciate, the spending by the wealthy doesnt fluctuate with the economy.Therefore, the spending of the lower wealth classes drives marginal changes in consumption.
As such, the condition of the not-so-wealthy is most important for forecasting changes in consumption.Deciphering personal data has also become more difficult because our spending habits have changed due to the pandemic.A great example is revenge spending. Per the New York Times:So, between the growing wealth divide and irregular spending habits, lets quantify personal savings, debt usage, and real wages to appreciate better if Bougie Broke is a mass movement or a silly meme.Savings, debt, and wages are the three primary sources that give consumers the ability to consume.The graph below shows the rollercoaster on which personal savings have been since the pandemic. The savings rate is hovering at the lowest rate since those seen before the 2008 recession.The total amount of personal savings is back to 2017 levels. But, on an inflation-adjusted basis, its at 10-year lows.
On average, most consumers are drawing down their savings or less. Given that wages are increasing and unemployment is historically low, they must be consuming more.Now, strip out the savings of the uber-wealthy, and its probable that the amount of personal savings for much of the population is negligible.
A survey by Payroll.org estimates that 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.The Feds latest, albeit old, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households from June 2023 claims that
over a third of households do not have enough savings to cover an unexpected $400 expense.
We venture to guess that number has grown since then. To wit, the number of households with essentially no savings rose 5% from their prior report a year earlier.After periods where consumers drained their existing savings and/or devoted less of their paychecks to savings, they either slowed their consumption patterns or borrowed to keep them up. Currently, it seems like many are choosing the latter option. Consumer borrowing is accelerating at a quicker pace than it was before the pandemic.The first graph below shows outstanding credit card debt fell during the pandemic as the economy cratered. However, after multiple stimulus checks and broad-based economic recovery, consumer confidence rose, and with it, credit card balances surged.The current trend is steeper than the pre-pandemic trend. Some may be a catch-up, but the current rate is unsustainable.
Consequently, borrowing will likely slow down to its pre-pandemic trend or even below it as consumers deal with higher credit card balances and 20+% interest rates on the debt.The second graph shows that since 2022, credit card balances have grown faster than our incomes. Like the first graph, the credit usage versus income trend is unsustainable, especially with current interest rates.With many consumers maxing out their credit cards, is it any wonder buy-now-pay-later loans (BNPL) are increasing rapidly?Insider Intelligence believes that 79 million Americans, or a quarter of those over 18 years old, use BNPL.
Lending Tree claims that 
nearly 1 in 3 consumers (31%) say theyre at least considering using a buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan this month.
More telling
,
according to their survey, only 52% of those asked are confident they can pay off their BNPL loan without missing a payment!Wages have been growing above trend since the pandemic. Since 2022, the average annual growth in compensation has been 6.28%. Higher incomes support more consumption, but higher prices reduce the amount of goods or services one can buy. Over the same period, real compensation has grown by less than half a percent annually. The average real compensation growth was 2.30% during the three years before the pandemic.In other words, compensation is just keeping up with inflation instead of outpacing it and providing consumers with the ability to consume, save, or pay down debt.The
unemployment rate
is 3.9%, up slightly from recent lows but still among the lowest rates in the last seventy-five years.The uptick in credit card usage, decline in savings, and the savings rate argue that consumers are slowly running out of room to keep consuming at their current pace.However, the most significant means by which we consume is income. If the unemployment rate stays low, consumption may moderate.
But, if the recent uptick in unemployment continues, a recession is extremely likely, as we have seen every time it turned higher.Its not just those losing jobs that consume less. Of greater impact is a loss of confidence by those employed when they see friends or neighbors being laid off.Accordingly, the labor market is probably the most important leading indicator of consumption and of the ability of the Bougie Broke to continue to be Bougie instead of flat-out broke!There are always consumers living above their means. This is often harmless until their means decline or disappear. The Bougie Broke meme and the ability social media gives consumers to flaunt their wealth is a new medium for an age-old message.Diving into the data, it argues that consumption will likely slow in the coming months. Such would allow some consumers to save and whittle down their debt. That situation would be healthy and unlikely to cause a recession.The potential for the unemployment rate to continue higher is of much greater concern. The combination of a higher unemployment rate and strapped consumers could accentuate a recession."
Investing.com,"Gold Plunges, EUR/USD Holds Steady on Higher Than Expected US CPI Data",2024-03-13,0.333333,"The
gold
(XAU) price plunged by more than 1.2% on Tuesday as the
US dollar
(USD) strengthened following the release of higher-than-expected US inflation figures.The US core Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.4% in February, while the headline CPI rose towards 3.4% year-on-year, above analysts' estimates and above the Federal Reserve's (Fed) official target. The figures suggest that inflation in the US remains sticky and questions the central bank's ability to ease its monetary policy in 2024. Still, it seems the market isn't ready to dismiss the possibility of the interest rate reduction in June. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, traders continue to price in a 57% chance of a 25-basis-point (bps) interest rate cut during that month.While gold bulls will continue to look for any reason that may drive XAU/USD higher, the fundamental and technical picture for the pair has worsened over Tuesday.XAU/USD was flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the economic calendar has no major news that could potentially provide strong momentum for gold traders. As long as the XAU/USD remains below 2,170, it may be reasonable to sell the rallies. 'In the short run, prices will see some consolidation and probably stabilise around the 2,100 level and will break above 2,200 by the end of the Q2 this year,' said Aakash Doshi, the head of commodities at Citi Research.EUR/USD
briefly dropped below the important 1.09000 level on Tuesday but then recovered and finished the day essentially unchanged.Higher-than-expected US inflation figures put upward pressure on the US dollar, but it didn't significantly affect EUR/USD. One of the reasons why the pair didn't plunge deeper is because eurozone inflation also remains elevated. Germany, the eurozone's major economy, reported a 2.7% year-on-year increase in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) yesterday, aligning with the market's expectations but being above the European Central Bank's (ECB) inflation target. Still, traders continue to expect the ECB to deliver slightly more rate cuts than the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2024. In theory, this divergence in monetary policy expectations should exert downward pressure on EUR/USD. However, because the divergence isn't substantial, a sideways trend will likely persist for some time.EUR/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The market will likely remain relatively quiet for the rest of the day as the economic calendar is rather uneventful. Most traders will be preparing for the US Producer Price Index and Retail Sales data releases tomorrow. The short-term technical bias remains neutral as EUR/USD continues to trade within the narrow 1.090001.09800 range.The
Canadian dollar
(CAD) reached a 5-day low on Tuesday due to unexpectedly high US inflation figures.US consumer prices rose significantly due to increased gasoline and shelter costs, hinting at persistent inflation that could force the Federal Reserve (Fed) to postpone the expected June rate cut for later. Meanwhile, Friday's data revealed that Canada's economy gained 40,700 jobs in Februarytwice the expected figureeven as the central bank keeps its interest rates highest in 22 years. Wage growth experienced a slowdown for the second consecutive month. Moreover, despite the job gains, the unemployment rate increased slightly to 5.8%, as reported by Statistics Canada.He anticipates the first rate reduction in June. The Bank of Canada (BOC) may not want to diverge too much from the Fed interest rate path if it leads to a weaker Canadian dollar and higher import costs.USD/CAD was mostly unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the economic calendar is rather uneventful, so strong moves in the market are unlikely. The recent CFTC data indicates a significant shift in sentiment, putting a strong bearish pressure on the Canadian dollar ahead of the BOC interest rate decision. The trend might persist today due to the absence of market-stimulating news."
Investing.com,Stock Market Remains Resilient Amidst Fed's Dovish Expectations and Inflation Reality,2024-03-13,0.333333,"Inflation in the US accelerated, not only in terms of monthly headline figures but everywhere, both core and headline, and both yearly and monthly figures came in hotter-than-expected. While gasoline prices counted among the major drivers of monthly inflation, shelter, electricity, used cars, air travel, and clothes remained the major drivers of inflation on a yearly basis. That was not an encouraging CPI read. The
US 2-year yield
spiked past 4.60% on the fear that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may not be able to cut the rates as soon as we think it will, and the
10-year
advanced to 4.17% after the sale of a $39 billion worth of 10-year notes. The
US Dollar Index
made an attempt past the 103 level, and major currencies retreated against a broadly stronger
greenback
on softer dovish Fed expectations. The
EUR/USD
tested the 1.09 level and
gold
fell to $2150 per ounce.Key takeaway: Hotter-than-expected inflation will likely call for caution at next weeks FOMC meeting and get the Fed members to sound cautious about the timing and the number of rate hikes that they have in mind for this year. Happily, we dont need to speculate much as the new dot plot is due as soon as next week. For now, the June cut expectation remains the base-case scenario  with a slightly lower 66% assessed to it after yesterdays inflation update, and the Fed is expected to cut three times before the end of the year. But dont dream rosy, the Fed members will probably sound cautious about the risk of inflation uptick.Stock markets shrugged off the bad vibes from the unideal CPI data in a record time. The
S&P 500
fell as a kneejerk reaction to hotter-than-expected inflation data but losses remained very short-lived, and the index advanced to a fresh record instead on the narrative that, yes, inflation was hotter-than-expected, but it couldve been worse.Of course, if we function that way, we dont need data anymore. So lets admit that yesterday's stock market reaction to the data was unusual and irrational. The bullish trend is too strong to let go of and FOMO  fear of missing out - the AI rally is the major driver of the big-cap stocks right now.On the other hand, inflation is not necessarily bad news for AI-related stocks. Higher inflation coupled with decreased pricing power for companies means stronger efforts to cut costs. And there is nothing better than turning to AI to cut costs effectively without necessarily giving up productivity. In this context, AI could be a hedge against an extended period of above-target inflation. But does that justify the 7% jump in Nvidia's (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) stock price yesterday?Sterling fell against the dollar as softer-than-expected jobs data in the UK reassured the Bank of England (BoE) doves and boosted the expectation of rate cuts this year to almost three following the data. Cable fell below 1.2750 yesterday but the pair has rebounded since and is ready to test the 1.28 resistance this morning as the BoE is not in a rush to start cutting rates either. Released this morning, GDP numbers came in line with expectations while construction output rose more than expected. The positive data should temper the pound selloff.In Japan, all eyes are on wage negotiations as many Japanese unions disclose their pay deals with employers this week. Yen traders are closely watching the news as any pickup in wages should boost inflation expectations and get the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to exit the negative rates sooner rather than later. So far, it seems that big corporations meet wage demands. Japans biggest union group Rengo will give its initial count on Friday, and its expected to secure a pay rise of above 4% - a thing that has not happened in three decades due to a sticky deflation in Japan. Any positive surprise on the wages front should boost the BoJ hawks and the speculation that the BoJ could hike rates as soon as next week. The
USD/JPY
saw support below 147 this week but the downside risks prevail. I believe that the BoJ is more likely to give a strong hint that it will hike rates than hike next week. But no one knows how the BoJ will hike rates. Would they rather surprise the market or prepare investors? Its been so long since the BoJ last hiked rates.US crude
tested the 200-DMA to the upside as the API data printed a 5.5-mio barrel fall in US oil inventories last week. OPEC raised its economic outlook for the year and said that oil demand will increase by 2.25mbpd this year and by 1.85mbpd next year. That was unchanged from their previous forecast. Still, oil bulls remained timid above the 200-DMA and the barrel of US crude is trading below this level this morning. A delay in Fed cuts could further reinforce offers above $80pb level."
Investing.com,Recession on Hold? Stocks Surge Despite Lingering Red Flags,2024-03-13,0.666667,"The combination of the
ISM Manufacturing New Orders
Index (NOI) and the yield curve, our two favorite high-frequency leading indicators of US recession, has been warning of imminent recession since September 2023.The warning has not been timely in that no recession has materialized yet. Furthermore, a month ago we noted that while the message of the yield curve was unchanged, the NOI had just risen by enough to move well above its recession demarcation level of 48. Although this did not cancel its recession warning (it would have to move above 55 to do so), Januarys rise to 52.5 was unexpected. Have subsequent data provided useful new clues?The answer is yes and no. The following monthly chart shows that the NOI turned back down in February, meaning that its recession warning is intact. At the same time, the
SPX
made a new all-time high as recently as Monday 4th March. As previously advised, it would be unprecedented for the SPX to make a new 52-week high AFTER the official recession start time.This means that recession warnings remain in place, but the earliest time for the start of a recession has been pushed out again. Specifically, the March 2024 new high for the SPX suggests that a recession will not start any sooner than May 2024.By our reckoning, during the first half of 2022, the US economy entered the bust phase of the economic boom-bust cycle caused by monetary inflation (rapid monetary inflation causes a boom that inevitably is followed by a bust as the receding monetary tide exposes the boom-time mal-investments). The bust phase almost always culminates in a recession, although it doesnt have to.So far, the performances of commodity prices in both US$ terms and gold terms are consistent with an economy in the bust phase, in that the GSCI Spot Commodity Index (GNX) made a 2-year low in US$ terms in December 2023 and currently is near a 3-year low in
gold
terms.The following daily chart shows GNX in gold terms. Whats not consistent with the bust phase are credit spreads, which have returned to their boom-time levels. Note that the narrowness of credit spreads and the strong upward trend in the stock market are linked, in that they are both symptomatic of a widespread view that a new boom will begin without a preceding severe economic downturn.The above-mentioned conflict will have to be resolved over the months ahead by credit spreads widening substantially in response to evidence of economic weakness or by the prices of industrial commodities rising substantially in response to evidence that a new boom has been ignited. We think that the former is by far the more likely outcome."

Since the U.S. is the lead economy, representing about 25% of the global economy in terms of absolute GDP in dollars, and being the dollar the reserve currency, we will focus on the U.S. data. Nothing indicates that the U.S. is going to lose this leadership soon, and it has been in the lead for around a century already.
First of all, here is today's data. The
SP500
is at
5.137,08
, literally a new all time high. The
U.S. interest rate
is
5.5%
. This is a high interest. The unemployment is low 3.7%, and it has been like that for several months. Finally, inflation is at 3.1%, an acceptable rate, after being as high as almost 9% back in 2022. That is why the interest got so high recently, to make sure inflation came down as it did. Now that both unemployment rate and inflation are within the Fed targets, there is no need to change the interest rate. Focusing only on this data, we can only say we are in front of a strong economy. So
this should not be a bad moment to invest. However, high interest rate is a warning sign
.
Let's put that in the context of the following historical graph. It shows the SP500 value [black], the U.S. interest rate [blue], and with the recession periods [gried out]."
Investing.com,3 Key Areas to Watch Ahead of the November 2024 Election,2024-03-14,0.222222,"Super Tuesday was, if I may, super obvious. Former President Donald Trump clinched nearly every delegate that was up for grabs last week, forcing his Republican challenger, Nikki Haley, out of the race, which all but guarantees his nomination. Trumps poll numbers, as aggregated by RealClearPolitics, also show him pulling further ahead of President Joe Biden, whose own favorability remains in the doldrums as the border crisis continues unabated.Eight months remain until the general election, but I dont believe its too soon for investors to prepare for a potential second Trump term. And lets be clear: Trump, should he win, would be constitutionally limited to a single additional term, the same as Biden. Since the current administration has reversed a number of Trump-era policiesespecially those involving immigrationTrump and lawmakers would need to work fast to implement new legislation and policies before the end of those four years.Below are three areas for investors to watch in the event of a Trump victory this November.Immigration is the top issue on most Americans minds right now, according to a recent Gallup poll; its also arguably the topic most associated with Trump.Since Biden took office in 2021, a record number of undocumented migrants have poured into the U.S., alarming families and businesses alike and straining many communities infrastructure and resources. So far in fiscal 2024, which began in October 2023, there have been nearly 1 million recorded migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border, exceeding the total amount in most previous years. The U.S. now has a record number of foreign-born people living within its borders at 49.5 million, or 15% of the total population, the Census Bureau reported in October.Should voters put Trump back in the White House, I expect well see swift action on the immigration front. Well likely see the re-implementation of old Trump policies, including Remain in Mexico, and as recently as last month, the former president vowed to enact the largest deportation operation in American history. A majority of Americans, or 53%, now support building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a Monmouth University poll conducted in February.The bottom line is that people want to feel safe. Safety is a fundamental need on Maslows hierarchy of needs, alongside food and water, and Americans are increasingly feeling unsafe.During President Trumps administration, U.S. small-cap stocks, as measured by the
Russell 2000
, performed competitively with the
S&P 500
as Trump shifted the governments attention to domestic policy. Thiscoupled with the 2017 tax reform law, a historic wave of deregulation, low borrowing costs and low inflationhelped smaller, America first companies thrive.Today, the market looks very different. Since the start of Bidens presidency, the S&P 500 has advanced almost 40%, with the lions share of those gains occurring in the last four months as investors, anticipating rate cuts in 2024, scrambled to get exposure to large artificial intelligence (AI) stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
), Alphabet (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:
NVDA
). The Russell 2000, by comparison, has remained essentially flat over the same period.What this means is that small-caps are now at their lowest valuation relative to large-caps since the dotcom bubble more than 20 years ago. A buying opportunity?Like immigration, I believe a second Trump term would hit the ground running supporting domestic-focused, Mom and Pop-style stores and businesses. During his administration, optimism among small U.S. businesses consistently ran high, with the National Federation of Independent Businesss (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index hitting an all-time high reading of 108.8 in August 2018. Since that time, the index has fallen more than 17%, registering 89.9 in January 2024.The last area I want to touch on is energy, which many voters and investors also associate with Trump.During his administration, gasoline prices remained on the lower end as producers kept the oil flowing. This came to a screeching halt four years ago with the pandemic, but since then, the U.S. has regained its status as the worlds leading supplier of crude. In December 2023, the last month of available data, the U.S. produced a jaw-dropping 13.3 million barrels per day on average. This resulted in a new record amount of oil pumped in a single year, surpassing the previous record set in 2019 when the U.S. produced 4.49 billion barrels.Interestingly, producers managed to do this even as the number of active oil rigs in North America has continue to trend down. According to Baker Hughes, there were 506 active rigs at the beginning of March 2024, down approximately 70% from the high in October 2014.So what gives? A new report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) asks this very question, finding that new and improved technologies, including hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling, have increased well productivity, enabling U.S. producers to extract more
crude oil
from new wells drilled while maintaining production from legacy wells.Producers, in other words, are able to do much more today with far less.As such, Trump 2.0 would have even less incentive to continue subsidizing renewable energy development. Last year, it was reported that he would gut the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bidens centerpiece climate legislation, chockfull of tax incentives, funding and loans to help the economy transition to clean energy.***Disclaimer:Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Investing.com,Rates Wake Up to the Possibility That Fed Cuts May Not Come This Year,2024-03-14,0.666667,"Stocks finished mostly lower on the day, with the
S&P 500
dropping 19 bps and the
NASDAQ 100
falling by 83 bps.Today, we get
PPI
and
Retail sales
, and based on the
VIX
1-Day, the market doesnt seem as concerned, with the implied volatility gauge closing at 11.9 and well below the 19 levels seen ahead of the
CPI
print.So, it seems unlikely that we see a volatility crush today.In the meantime, one-year inflation swaps closed yesterday at their highest levels since October 2023 (white line), and one-year breakevens (blue line) closed at their highest since the summer of 2022.But yesterday was a big day for things like
gasoline
, which broke out and surged 3% above resistance and probably has room to run to around $2.70.It was a big day for
copper
which rose almost 3.5% and appears to have broken out.It is no wonder why inflation expectations are surging. The things that have helped suppress and tell the disinflationary tale are now coming back to life.When you look at the CPI index, the only thing that is accounting for inflation is core services. Food, energy, and core goods are all non-existent.But suddenly, this can start to look much different if
oil
, copper, and gasoline breaks and starts to pick up steam. I havent mentioned the shipping rate surge seen since the start of the year.(Bloomberg)Why shouldnt risk assets be rising? Financial conditions, as measured by the Chicago Fed, are in the same spot as they were in February 2022, before the Fed Funds rate was 535 bps lower, and the balance sheet was more than $1 trillion larger.At the end of the day, stocks are risk assets, and you know what: copper, gasoline, and oil are risk assets.So why should stocks go higher and other risk assets not go higher? This is the same reason that gold is going higher. They are saying the same thing: financial conditions are too easy, and inflation is now at risk of coming back.The only good news is that rates are slowly waking up to the idea that rate cuts may not manifest this year as this inflation risk is starting to build.Yesterday, we had
10-year
rates move back above the 4.19% level, which potentially opens the door for a rise back to the 4.35% region if the data today is supportive.Thats it.Original Post"
Investing.com,Doubt About June Rate Cuts Keeps Creeping Higher - PPI Another Headwind for Fed,2024-03-14,0.333333,"The mixed news on inflation earlier this
week
and
today
didnt help, but neither did sticky inflation news derail
expectations
that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in June. Yet uncertainty about the timing is creeping higher, as a confluence of factors muddy the outlook.Lets start with Fed funds futures, which are currently pricing in a roughly 67% probability that the Fed will start to trim its current 5.25%-to-5.50% target rate at the June 12 FOMC meeting. Thats moderately lower vs. the 77% probability estimate
from three weeks ago
.Meanwhile, the policy-sensitive
2-year Treasury yield
continues to trade far below the Fed funds rate. That implies a strong expectation in the bond market that interest rates will be lower in the near term.There are also signs that current Fed policy is too tight relative to macro conditions. For example, a simple model that compares the Fed funds rate to unemployment and inflation suggests that theres room to ease monetary policy.Several prominent economic voices have recently recommended patience for rate cuts. JP Morgans CEO Jamie Dimon, for example, this week advised:Sycamore Tree Capital Partners Mark Okada goes further and tells CNBC that theres a good chance they dont cut at all this year.Former Treasury Sec. Larry Summers recently opined that the neutral rate is higher than the Fed estimates, which suggests that the case for cutting interest rates is weak relative to current economic conditions.But for those who adhere to the dont-fight-the-Fed rule, the implied message is to listen to the central bankers. On that note, Fed Chairman Powell reaffirmed in testimony to Congress last week that rate cuts are nigh."

Investing.com,"Gold Prices, EUR/USD Rise Amid Weakness in Dollar; Bitcoin Soars to Fresh All-Time",2024-03-14,0.333333,"The
gold
(XAU) price rose by 0.76% on Wednesday as the
US dollar
continued to weaken on hopes that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would cut its base rate in June despite a higher-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data published on Tuesday.The latest US Bureau of Labour Statistics report indicated that inflation wasn't slowing as the market had expected. Still, investors refuse to believe the Fed could delay interest rate cuts any further. Traders continue to price in an almost 70% probability that the easing of the monetary policy will begin in June. As a result, gold prices remain elevated, and traders seem to be driven by the 'buy-the-dip' mood.XAU/USD was falling slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the market will likely face above-normal volatility in the American session as the US will release a batch of important macroeconomic statistics. Three reportsProducer Price Index (PPI), Retail Sales, and Jobless Claimswill be published at 12:30 p.m. UTC and will likely cause sharp moves in all USD pairs. Stronger-than-expected figuresindicating rising prices, solid consumer confidence, and a tight labour marketwill likely have a bearish impact on XAU/USD. Otherwise, weak figures will likely push XAU/USD higher. The key levels to watch are 2,180 and 2,160.The euro (EUR) rose by 0.2% as the US dollar weakened on Wednesday due to investors consolidating gains ahead of this week's economic data.The US dollar weakened yesterday, losing some gains made after unexpectedly high US inflation figures. Investors are now repositioning and awaiting more economic updates to define the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy path this year. The February US Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a higher-than-expected increase in prices, indicating persistent inflation. Month-on-month data aligned with the forecast, while the annual figures slightly exceeded predictions. Market expectations for a rate cut by the Fed before summer remain low, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Conversely, expectations for the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates by June are high, potentially putting downward pressure on the euro. Also, a dip in the eurozone industrial production at the beginning of the year hints at potential economic challenges. ECB official Francois Villeroy de Galhau hints at a possible rate cut in spring, and Martins Kazaks suggests rate reductions could start if economic conditions meet ECB forecasts. Upcoming speeches by ECB members Frank Elderson and Isabel Schnabel could also clarify the central bank's stance.In today's Asian trading session,
EUR/USD
stayed close to 1.09500, attempting to preserve yesterday's gains. Today, traders should pay attention to US reports: the Producer Price Index, the Retail Sales, and Initial Jobless Claims, all due at 12:30 p.m. UTC. These reports will provide insights into the current state of the US labour market and inflation rate and affect investors' interest rate expectations, which could impact EUR/USD. If the data exceed expectations, the chance of a rate cut by the Fed in summer may decrease, leading to a drop in EUR/USD, possibly below 1.09000. Otherwise, chances for the imminent rate cut will rise, potentially driving EUR/USD higher, towards 1.09800.On Wednesday,
Bitcoin
(BTC) reached a historical high near 73,700 on the back of a capital rotation from long-term holders to new investors.This week's The Week Onchain report from Glassnode highlights that Bitcoin has surpassed its all-time high of 69,000 in November 2021, marking the fourth historic peak in its life cycle. Analyst Checkmate points out the recent surge past 72,000, propelling this phase of the Bitcoin bull run into the 'euphoria zone', a stage typically associated with setting new all-time highs. Other data indicates that the market sentiment is currently in the 'extreme greed zone': investors may become overly enthusiastic as the market rises, leading to fear of missing out (FOMO) and attracting speculators.MicroStrategy, the software development company, recently filed for a $500 million convertible debt offering to fund more Bitcoin purchases. This follows an $800 million raise used to buy 12,000 bitcoins. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings could reach 205,000, valued at nearly $15 billion. With the new funds, they might buy an additional 6,800 bitcoins with BTC prices at around 73,000. Overall, the interest of large companies in Bitcoin suggests that its growth potential has not yet been exhausted.During the Asian trading session,
BTC/USD
attempted to surpass yesterday's high but failed to break above the strong resistance at 73,700. Swissblock, the digital asset analytics firm, noted on Wednesday that after Bitcoin's price almost doubled from 38,000 since late January without experiencing significant drops, a period of consolidation might be upcoming. They emphasised that 'nothing rallies in a straight line. Not even BTC,' hinting at a potential correction.The natural gas (
XNG
) price dropped by more than 3% on Wednesday. Weather prediction models indicated that temperature in the US over the next 15 days would rise faster than expected, hurting heating demand estimates. In addition, an ongoing outage at the Freeport liquefied
natural gas
(LNG) export plant in Texas has reduced the aggregate volume of natural gas flowing to liquefaction. Overall, the front-month futures contract has lost over 15% in the past six trading sessions. However, XNG/USD is now sitting on strong support in the 1.65001.600 area, while natural gas companies continue reducing production to alleviate the storage surplus and lift the prices.XNG/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the US Energy Information Agency (EIA) will publish its regular Natural Gas Storage report at 2:30 p.m. UTC. The data will almost certainly affect the price of US natural gas. The EIA report will indicate the change in the volume of natural gas held in the underground storage over the past week. According to Reuters, analysts expect the stockpiles to have decreased by 3 billion cubic feet in the week to 8 March. The report will be bullish if the EIA shows a larger-than-expected stock decline, pushing XNG/USD towards 1.80. Alternatively, a smaller decline in inventories than forecasted may bring XNG/USD down, probably towards 1.60."
Investing.com,Crude Oil Prices Rise as Ukraine Hits Russian Refineries,2024-03-14,0.222222,"The direction was mixed yesterday, as Tuesdays hotter-than-expected US CPI print gave cold feet to investors regarding the Federal Reserves (Fed) ability to cut interest rates as soon as in June. The
S&P 500
and
Nasdaq
consolidated near record, and energy stocks helped temper losses in the S&P 500 as technology stocks traded down. The
Dollar Index
rebounded as the selloff in Treasuries accelerated despite a strong
30-year
bond auction.Today, the focus is on the US retail sales and producer price inflation data. Retail sales are expected to have rebounded following a relatively weak read in January, while producer prices are expected to have risen in February, fueled by higher energy prices.Normally, I would expect higher-than-expected retail sales and higher-than-expected PPI data to temper the Fed rate cut bets, back a further rise in US yields and the
dollar
, and trigger a downside correction in the US stock markets.Speaking of
oil
prices, the positive pressure is building after the EIA data confirmed a 1.5 mio barrel fall in US oil inventories last week, and after Ukraine attacked major Russian oil refineries with drones and damaged around 12% of the countrys oil-processing capacity. The barrel of US crude tested the $80pb level. Offers near $80pb could be cleared on the back of rising tensions, yet I doubt that we will see a sustainable rise in oil prices above this level when the geopolitical jitters disappear from the headlines. There is still strong resistance within the $80/82pb range.Elsewhere, tensions between the US and China are on the rise again, as the US House passed a bill to ban TikTok unless the Chinese ByteDance sells the platform to a third party that would comply with the US data security demands. The bill is on its way to the White House. The US accuses China of using user data and building propaganda using the platform. The affair is highly political of course, and it is one more major point that opposes the two presidential candidates, Biden and Trump. Biden says he will sign the bill, while Trump says banning TikTok would give too much power to Facebook (NASDAQ:
META
), which he openly dislikes  as the platform imposed a ban on the ex-president after the Capitol riot back in 2021. Meta didnt react much to the news.European stocks extended gains and hit fresh records as energy and luxury names led the rally higher yesterday. The
EUR/USD
consolidates gains below the 1.10 level and should see solid resistance into this level, especially if we see another hot inflation report from the US today. European Central Banks (ECB) Wunsch said yesterday that the bank may eventually start lowering the interest rates without being sure that inflation is returning to the 2% target, and that the latter decision could come before so long. Listening to Lagarde and other ECB members, it sounds like a June cut is a done deal unless a significant surprise occurs on the inflation front. But a lot can change from now to June. If tensions between Ukraine and Russia escalate in a way to boost oil prices, we will certainly see the central banks constrained to delay their rate cut plans. For now, however, the expectation is that the ECB will start cutting in June and cut 4 times this year. The bank also announced changes to its operational framework in a way to allow the banks in different locations to ask for the liquidity that they need so that the monetary policy could be more flexible to better meet the various needs of various economies across the bloc as excess liquidity dries out. The market reaction to the latter changes is expected to be limited."

PPI
report, which sharply increased rates and the
dollar
, helping widen credit spreads.The
10-year
rate rose by ten bps on the day, and that means we are again on the watch for a breach of the 4.35% level.This level has held despite multiple attempts since the start of the year. A move beyond 4.35% is needed to intensify the equity market sell-off.The CDX High Yield index rose 8 points yesterday to just below 330. You cant say it has broken out at this point, but it is close.We need to see it get above 350 before we can start to think about spread widening even more. Right now, it is just too soon. But this is something we need to watch.The
S&P 500
s current earnings yield trades in lockstep with this CDX index, and so if the CDX HY index keeps going higher, then the S&P 500 earnings yield should keep going higher.Essentially, stocks have just been a reflection of the mood for high-yield credit.Whats odd about the equity market is that despite the big rally following the
CPI
report, the
NASDAQ
is down two bps points this week.Today is OPEX, so it will probably be a busy session, but I was surprised to see that all of the gains from the rally are gone.I used rally because, as I explained on Tuesday, the rally was just an implied volatility crush, and I think that point has now been proven.Im just waiting to see if that 17,850 level breaks and the gap from Nvidia's (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) results finally gets filled.In the meantime, Adobe (NASDAQ:
ADBE
) wont help today, with the shares trading down 10% after hours.The company gave weak quarterly revenue guidance in a range of $5.25 to $5.30 billion, versus estimates of $5.31 billion, which will not cut it in this market.The stock is trading around $510 after hours, and the level around $505 seems pretty important to the shares, with a break of support creating an opportunity for that gap to fill about 13% lower than its after-hours pricing.Anyway, have a good one.Original Post"
Investing.com,Fed Meeting Poses Pivotal Test for Market as Slowing GDP Meets Stubborn Inflation,2024-03-15,0.333333,"A new round of nowcasts continue to estimate that US economic activity will downshift in next months release of first-quarter
GDP
data. Todays revised estimate is based on the median for a set of nowcasts compiled by CapitalSpectator.com.Output for the January-through-March period is currently projected to soften to a 2.1% increase (seasonally adjusted annual rate). The estimate reflects a substantially softer rise vs. Q4s strong 3.2% advance, which in turn marks a downshift from Q3s red-hot 4.9% increase,according to government data.Todays revised Q1 estimate was essentially unchanged from the previous Q1 nowcast (
published on Mar. 7
). At this late date in the current quarter, the odds are relatively high that the current median estimate is a reasonable guesstimate for the actual GDP data that the Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish in late-April.GDP rising at roughly a 2% pace marks another slowdown from recent quarters, but if the current nowcast is correct it suggests that recession risk remains low. The question is whether the slowdown persists into Q2 and beyond.Given the expected deceleration in growth on tap for Q1, the economy may be flirting with a tipping point for recession later in the year. Its premature to make such a forecast with high confidence, but its a scenario thats increasingly plausible, albeit speculatively so for now.Yesterdays release of
retail sales
numbers for February aligns with the possibility that even softer growth is coming. Although spending rebounded last month after Januarys steep decline, the bounce was lower than expected.Reviewing retail spending on a year-over-year basis provides a clearer view of the softer growth profile. The pace edged up to 1.5% last month vs. the year-earlier level, but thats close to the slowest increase in the post-pandemic recovery.Despite emerging signs of slowing growth, relief for the economy in the form of interest-rate cuts may be further out in time than recently expected, due to the latest round of sticky inflation news this week."

gold
(XAU) price is on track for its first weekly decrease since mid-February following the release of mixed US data.Gold dropped below 2,160 on Thursday, facing its first decline in 4 weeks, due to unexpectedly strong US inflation data that shifted expectations for rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to a later time. Precious metals also suffered from the sharp recovery of the
US dollar
and Treasury yields after reports showed that US producer and consumer prices exceeded forecasts in February. Other data indicated a recovery in US retail sales in the last month, although figures were lower than the forecast. Moreover, the Jobless Claims report indicated a decrease in unemployment claims.He suggested that current market conditions and inflation make significant short-term increases in XAU/USD unlikely as the stronger US dollar raises the cost of gold for holders of other currencies. The Fed is expected to maintain current rates in March and May, and the chance of the rate cut has decreased from 74% to around 60% after stronger-than-anticipated US reports. Now, the market predicts around 3 rate cuts in 2024, compared to previous forecasts of 3 to 4 reductions.XAU/USD was rising in the Asian and early European trading sessions. Investors await the upcoming US Michigan Consumer Sentiment report at 2:00 p.m. UTC today. Lower-than-expected figures could boost XAU/USD, potentially pushing its price towards 2,180. However, if the data surpasses expectations, the downward trend in XAU/USD will likely continue.The euro (EUR) lost 0.59% on Thursday after the US macroeconomic data came out mixed but showed accelerating producer inflation.Although US retail sales in February were lower than expected, the number of jobless claims declined, and the Producer Price Index (PPI) jumped sharply. Overall, the data questions the Federal Reserve's (Fed) plan to cut its base rate in the near term. Thus, the data strengthened the US dollar. Still, the market expects the Fed to deliver the rate cut in June, even though the probability has dropped towards 60% from around 70% prior to yesterday's data publication.Meanwhile, European Central Bank (ECB) officials continue to plan on delivering a rate cut in June but offer a different stance about the monetary policy path in 2024. Klaas Knot, the head of the Dutch central bank, said he anticipated 3 cuts in 2024, slightly fewer than what the financial markets are pricing in. At the same time, Yannis Stournaras, Greek central bank chief, told Bloomberg that he backed the first reduction in June, the second in July, and 2 more cuts by the end of the year. Fundamentally, the pressure on
EUR/USD
remains bearish as the market is pricing in more rate cuts from the ECB than from the Fed in 2024. According to the interest rate swap market data, investors expect roughly 88 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the ECB and just over 75 bps reductions by the Fed.EUR/USD continued to decline slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the US will release more data: the Empire State Manufacturing Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC and the Consumer Sentiment Index at 2:00 p.m. UTC. If the figures are stronger than expectedrevealing an increase in business activity and consumer confidenceEUR/USD will almost certainly continue to fall, probably towards 1.08000. Otherwise, the short-term bearish trend in EUR/USD may pause or even reverse. The key level to watch is 1.09000a break above the level will open the way towards 1.09600.The Japanese yen lost 0.39% on Thursday after the US dollar jumped higher due to stronger-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) data.USD/JPY
has been in a major uptrend since the year began. While the latest US macroeconomic data continues to strengthen USD/JPY, the market may be preparing for a downward correction. Kazuo Ueda, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor, has repeatedly signaled that the decision to launch the stimulus program depends on wage inflation. Still, the progress made in the annual wage talks certainly increases the likelihood that the central bank will finally increase its short-term interest rate target, terminate the bond yield control policy, and stop purchasing risky assets such as exchange-traded funds. Thus, if wage negotiations deliver strong results for workers, it will increase the chances of the regulator ending its decade-long, ultra-loose monetary policy. The final decision will be released on 19 March, but the bearish impact on USD/JPY may already emerge today.USD/JPY was relatively flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The market will focus on the preliminary results of wage negotiations today. However, the publication of the US datathe Empire State Manufacturing Index at 12:30 p.m. UTC and the Consumer Sentiment Index at 2:00 p.m. UTCmight also trigger volatility in USD/JPY. If the figures are stronger than expected and show an increase in business activity and consumer confidence, USD/JPY may rise above 148.600. Otherwise, the bullish trend in the pair will pause and may even reverse."
Investing.com,Market Rethinks Fed Policy,2024-03-15,0.333333,"Yesterdays mix of economic data  which pointed at higher-than-expected inflation and lower-than-expected spending in the US  finally broke the Federal Reserve (Fed) doves and the equity bulls back for at least a day. US producer price inflation jumped to 0.6% on a monthly basis in February, and to 1.6% on a yearly basis.Higher fuel and food prices were to blame. But even taking the volatile energy and food prices out, the core metric showed higher-than-expected price pressures last month, and core PPI remained steady at the 2% y-o-y. Retail sales, on the other hand, improved less than expected.The data forced the market to reconsider the Fed's expectations. The probability of a June rate cut fell to 60%. The

There is a chance that we see the median forecast show no more than two rate cuts penciled in by the Fed members for the year  instead of three plotted at Decembers dot plot. We will walk into next weeks FOMC meeting with a hawkish tilt knowing that its always better for the Fed not to act too early than to be forced to make a U-turn on the way.US crude
advanced to the $81pb level after Ukraine damaged 12% of Russias refining capacity with drone attacks. The IEA also gave support to the bulls yesterday by saying that they anticipate a supply deficit throughout this year if OPEC+ continues to cut output in Q2. This is a significant change in their forecast as they were pointing at a surplus in their earlier prediction. Trend and momentum indicators support a further rise in oil prices. But oil bulls could hit a wall if we see a hawkish shift from the Fed at next weeks meeting.The
EUR/USD
tumbled to 1.0873 on the back of a broadly stronger dollar and rising speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) will cut the rates even if its not fully sure that inflation is headed to 2% target according to the Belgian central bank head Pierre Wunsch. The Governor of the Bank of Greece goes a step further and says that the ECB should cut rates twice before its August break.However, let's return to reality. The ECB would find it challenging to act independently and implement numerous rate cuts if the Fed adopts a hawkish stance, leading to an appreciation of the
US dollar
. The ECB could take the risk of cutting before the Fed (in June) and announce one additional cut compared to the Fed at best before seeing inflation risks return to the bloc.Price-wise, the EUR/USD outlook remains bearish. The pair will step into a medium-term bearish consolidation zone if it slips below the 1.0867 level  the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on the February  March rebound, and could extend gains all the way down to 1.06 in the continuation of an ABCD pattern.Elsewhere, the
USD/JPY
is trending higher despite news that the wage negotiations in Japan show that big corporations meet the wage demand. Today, Rengo  the countrys biggest union group  will announce its numbers. Strong wage growth is inflationary and should convince the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to act sooner rather than later. However, the BoJ is expected to hold off until it obtains a clearer understanding of the wage landscape following the second and third rounds of negotiations, scheduled between the end of March and the beginning of April.These negotiations will not only encompass major corporations but also extend to medium and small-sized companies. This being said, given the positive news from the early negotiations, its interesting to see that the Japanese yen bulls dont hold a dominant position in the market this week. The USD/JPY is back above the 148 level. A broadly stronger US dollar certainly explains why the USD/JPY couldnt gain a further downside momentum this week, but given how cheap the yen has become, I would expect the yen bulls to resist to the dollars upside pressure. They have not. Still, I think that going short the yen at the current levels doesnt offer a potential worth taking the risk of a sizeable bullish run in the yen into next weeks BoJ decision.And speaking of decisions, the PBoC left its MLF rate unchanged today, while home prices fell for a 13thmonth in China warning that all the efforts deployed so far couldnt slow bleeding in the countrys problematic property sector."
Investing.com,Elliott Wave Live,2024-03-18,0.666667,"X market is in some tight ranges for the last two sessions, ahead of important CB policy decisions this week. We have FED, BOJ, RBA, BOE and SNB, but the most focus will be on FED and BOJ. The question is if both banks will stay in hold, or will they possibly change their policy decisions? Based on latest US data, FED may not be ready to act yet, and thats clearly visible through US yeilds that rebounded with USD last week. I assume that FED will not make any kind of new decisions, but they may delay any cuts, so the dollar can stay sideways or even see slightly more upside. On the other hand, we have BOJ with speculation that they may finally change their negative rate policy. After drop at the start of the month,
USDJPY
is recovering surprisingly well ahead of the event tomorrow, so if they really act, there will be big risk for USDJPY to drop IMO. If they wont deliver anything new, then USDJPY is going to stick with the current ranges.
From an Elliott wave perspective, I think the mid-term trends are not easy to predict at the moment for some of the FX pairs, but at least
USDMXN
looks to be breaking down with a new bearish leg, while metals are in uptrend. Cryptos are also making pullback.

Investing.com,AUD/USD,2024-03-18,0.666667,"A rate cut is unlikely for the Reserve Bank of Australia because inflation is still higher than the 23% target range. Further RBA decisions are unpredictablethe market awaits the press conference after the meeting.The Forex market is waiting for the decision on the key interest rate by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which is planned to be announced on 19 March. In February, the RBA had discussed a rate increase but ultimately decided to leave policy settings unchanged. The key rate of 4.35% was set in November 2023, when it was raised by 0.25% from the previous 4.10%. Since then, two RBA meetings in a row have resulted in the interest rate remaining unchanged. Economists lean towards the rate remaining unchanged at 4.35% in March, although any move is possible now.Currently, the RBA's key rate is at its highest level in the last 12 years. The decision to raise the rate was made against inflation that followed the COVID-19 epidemic when the annual rate rose to 6.59% in 2022 from 2.86% in 2021.The main goal of maintaining a high rate is to bring the inflation level back to the RBA's target range of 23%. In 2023, the annual inflation rate was 4.1%. In 2024, inflation is slowing down, and according to RBA's projections, at the end of 2024, it may be 3.2% instead of the 3.5% the central bank expected previously. However, this would still be above the target range.High-interest rates are supposed to support the national currency. However, in the backdrop of an economic recession, the effect of this support is very moderate.Australia's economic growth rates have been falling for the second year in a row. They fell by 5.6% (GDP, annual variation in %) in 2021, 3.8% in 2022, and 2.1% in 2023. Reducing the interest rate could boost growthfor example, by stimulating household spending.At the same time, high-interest rates deter Australians from taking new mortgages or refinancing home loans. This volume is decreasing for the second month in a row.The RBA must also consider data on credit card debt, which has been growing since November 2023, when the key rate was raised last. The population cannot make ends meet and is getting deeper into debt.Since the picture of an economic recession is evident, the RBA could return the key rate to the 4.10% mark to stimulate consumer spending. This would positively affect economic growth figures but could weaken the Australian dollar. However, this is unlikely to happen on 19 March.So, no surge in interest rates is expected after the RBA meeting on 19 March. However, comments made at the press conference may give a push to the market. If the RBA plans to keep the cash rate at 4.35% for longer,
AUD/USD
may move to 0.6667, prior to 0.6728 and 0.6871. Otherwise, the Australian dollar may move to 0.6542, followed by 0.6477, and finally 0.6442."
Investing.com,How Will the Bank of Japan Meeting Impact the Yen-Dollar Exchange Rate?,2024-03-18,0.555556,"On 19 March 2024, the Bank of Japan may raise the interest rate from -0.10 to positive for the first time in eight years, which will strongly affect the quotes of the
USD/JPY
currency pair.The Bank of Japan (BOJ) will announce its interest rate decision at the meeting on 19 March. The rate is expected to rise and come out of its negative value for the first time in eight years.The BOJ announced negative rates in January 2016 to overcome deflation and stimulate economic growth to achieve a sustainable price growth rate of 2% over the long term. Interest rates have been held at 0.1% for eight years. At its most recent meeting on 22 January 2023, the BOJ left the discount rate at 0.10% and the soft cap on the 10-year government bond yield at 1.00%. According to the data, the central bank has not yet reached the stage where Japan can avoid the risk of a return to deflation.The highest inflation rate in the past three years was seen in January 2023 at 4.3% per annum. Since then, Japanese financial institutions have managed to halve the inflation rate. By January 2024, it was at 2.2% per annum, almost reaching the 2% target the BOJ aims fora potential reason to consider an interest rate hike. Meanwhile, factors such as a technical default on government bonds and the announcement of union wage hikes made at the meeting on 13 March also suggest there is a possibility that the BOJ may take the opportunity to raise rates.On 13 March, USD/JPY came close to 148. If the BOJ does not announce the expected policy adjustment, it will encourage buyers, and their first target will be around 149, where the local resistance is located. If the BOJ takes action and announces further rate hikes, USD/JPY will likely fall below 146. This could be followed by an attempt to reach the lows of late last year."
Investing.com,Upcoming Fed Meeting to Decide Future Trends in Gold and Euro,2024-03-18,0.333333,"The gold (XAU) price dropped by 0.25% on Friday, recording its first weekly decline in 3 weeks as U.S. inflation data disappointed the investors.Although Friday's U.S. economic dataEmpire State Manufacturing Index and preliminary Consumer Sentimentwas lower than expected, supporting lower interest rates, investors focused on the inflation reports released earlier in the week. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) figures were higher than expected. High inflation may force the Federal Reserve (Fed) to keep interest rates elevated for an extended period, putting downward pressure on the prices of non-yielding assets, such as gold.Still, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, traders continue to await the interest rate cut in June, even as the chances of this scenario have dropped to 55%, compared to 72% before the CPI data release.XAU/USD
was falling during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the economic calendar is relatively uneventful, so the established short-term bearish trend in gold may persist. Fundamentally, gold investors may reposition ahead of 5 central banks' interest rate decisions this week. Specifically, the Fed will announce its decision and issue the latest economic projections on Wednesday. Until then, XAU/USD's trend may lack clear direction.Initially,
EUR/USD
briefly dropped below the important 1.08800 level on Friday but then recovered and finished the day essentially unchanged.The U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index published by the University of Michigan decreased slightly to 76.5 in March, marking a 3-month low from February's 76.9 and being lower than expected. While there were slight improvements in personal finances, these were balanced by expectations of worsening business conditions. Consumers showed uncertainty about the economy's direction, especially with upcoming elections. The expectations index dropped slightly, but overall views on current conditions remained unchanged: investors anticipate the Federal Reserve (Fed) will begin cutting interest rates in June if inflation continues to ease as per forecasts, maintaining their projection of 3 rate cuts.The European Central Bank (ECB) maintained high borrowing costs at the policy meeting on 7 March but noted substantial progress in reducing inflation, initiating talks on the possibility of easing monetary policy.When asked about the possibility of 3 rate cuts of 25 basis points this year, De Cos avoided giving a specific timeline. Still, he noted that the current market conditions align with the ECB's goal to achieve a 2% inflation rate in the medium term.EUR/USD was moving sideways during the early hours of a Monday trading session. Today, traders should focus on the release of the final data for the eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) at 10:00 a.m. UTC. The report may trigger slight volatility, as the market has already adjusted its position after preliminary data publication. Everyone now awaits the Fed rate decision and FOMC economic projections on Wednesday. This event will clarify the future of U.S. monetary policy and impact EUR/USD. Until then, EUR/USD will likely move sideways.The Australian dollar (AUD) lost 0.30% on Friday as the
US dollar
continued to rise despite a weaker-than-expected Consumer Sentiment report and lower-than-expected Empire State Manufacturing Index figures.The bullish trend in
AUD/USD
persisting since mid-February may now reverse as higher-than-expected U.S. inflation figures lowered the probability of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), pushing the U.S. dollar higher. However, only a confident break below 0.65200 will trigger a new bearish trend in AUD/USD, and bears need a strong fundamental impetus to break the level.This week's policy rate decisions from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Fed will determine the AUD/USD's trend. The RBA will announce its rate decision on 19 March at 3:30 a.m. UTC. At the last meeting, the Australian central bank held its cash rate unchanged at 4.35% and will likely do so on Tuesday. However, inflation remains above the target, recently accelerating from 3.4% in December to 3.6% in January. Moreover, in the previous meeting, the RBA suggested the possibility of a rate hike as the growth in consumer prices slows not as fast as expected. Now, investors are pricing in roughly 37 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by RBA in 2024, with the first rate cut anticipated in August.The Fed's decision is due on Wednesday, and it will likely overshadow the RBA's meeting and may have a strong impact on AUD/USD. If the Fed delivers hawkish interest rate projections, investors will have to scale back their expectations for an early rate cut. Thus, the probability of a 25-bps rate reduction in June may decrease. In this case, AUD/USD will almost certainly decline, and a new bearish trend in the pair may start.AUD/USD was essentially flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Traders will focus on the RBA rate decision at 03:00 a.m. UTC on 19 March. If the RBA delivers a hawkish message, AUD/USD will almost certainly rallypossibly above 0.66400. However, if the RBA expresses readiness to cut the rates in summer, AUD/USD may decrease or stabilize in the range of 0.652000.66000."
Investing.com,Week of Central Bank Decisions Starts on Mixed Note,2024-03-18,0.666667,"A week packed with central bank decisions starts on a mixed note after hotter-than-expected US inflation sent the
US 2-year yield
around 25bp higher over the week and the
10-year yield
spiked past the 4.30% mark. Stocks resisted to higher yields for the major part of the week, but the mood was not brilliant on Friday. The
S&P 500
fell from an ATH, as equity bulls also started feeling the heat of hawkish fears before this weeks FOMC meeting and stocks in Europe were also sold off before the weekly closing bell.In the FX, last week saw the
US dollar
rebound and majors retreat against a globally stronger greenback. The
EUR/USD
sank below 1.09, Cable fell after hitting the highest level since last summer and the
USD/JPY
traded past the 149. While the dollars appreciation was easy to understand against the euro  where the European Central Bank (ECB) members sounded explicit about their intention to cut rates in June, and against
sterling
 where softer jobs data supported the Bank of England (BoE) doves, the persistent fall of the Japanese yen was surprising, even more so as the news that big Japanese corporation met the wages demand kept coming in throughout the week. On Friday, the countrys biggest union group announced that they secured a pay rise of nearly 5.30%. But in vain, the USD/JPY kept rising. The yen bulls remain surprisingly reluctant to take action and the implied volatility in the yen markets remains surprisingly low compared to the levels we saw back in summer, when the Bank of Japan (BoJ) decided to double its target rate on JGB 10-year yield, and last December, when the BoJ was supposed to give a clearer hint on when they would exit the negative rate policy.Some reasons for the lack of enthusiasm could be:Whatever it is, the yen bulls are tired of getting disappointed by Mr. Ueda, who hinted that the bank is not in a rush to normalize.Fed expectations for this weeks meeting are mixed. We know that the Fed wont change its interest rates this week, but the fresh forecasts and the dot plot will give a good hint on what the Fed members think about the latest economic data. The Fed members walk into this weeks meeting having seen a two-month jump in inflation, healthy jobs data, above-average economic growth, and robust corporate earnings. Yes, there has been renewed stress regarding the regional banks after the jitters around the NY Community (NYSE:
NYCB
) Bancorp at the start of the year but that stress has been isolated and contained. Hence, there is a chance that the Fed members plot fewer rate cuts for this year and we see the median expectation fall to 2 rate cuts, from 3 plotted in December. If thats the case, I would expect the US yields and the dollar to extend gains and the mood in equities sour and that would be such bad luck for Reddit thats preparing to go public on March 21.The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the Bank of England (BoE), and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) will also announce their latest policy verdict this week and are expected to maintain their rates unchanged. The SNB will likely follow in the footsteps of the ECB and act in the H1. The RBA on the other hand is much more concerned by renewed pressure on inflation and some RBA hawks even think that the bank wont cut the rates at all this year. A hawkish stance from the RBA may not stop the
AUD/USD
s selloff if the Fed sounds decidedly hawkish as well. The Aussie dollar is better bid this morning on better-than-expected Chinese data and news that the Chinese would maintain fiscal spending to boost growth. But we shall see the pair sink below 200-DMA if dollar bulls come back in charge."

Investing.com,There Was an Old Bank Who Swallowed a Rule,2024-03-18,0.333333,"To this day, banking confuses many. The industrys myriad of jargon and regulations can understandably perplex casual investors; however, they also confound expertseven those specializing in the discipline. Yet, banking is really quite simple. Banks borrow to lend. Their complexity is purely self-inflicted, created by the controls weve buried them under. Each new regulation adds to the burden bringing the industry one step closer to failure. The reflexive turn to regulatory solutions for industry hiccups reminds me of the old nursery rhyme: I dont know why she swallowed a flyperhaps shell die!In 1952, Rose Bonne and Alan Mills copyrighted a song version of the childrens rhyme
I Know an Old Lady
. The familiar tune tells the silly story of an old woman who keeps swallowing animals. Beginning with a fly, the creatures successively grow larger. The woman hopes that her latest meal will catch the animal she previously ate. The behavior continues until the woman swallows a horse which kills her (of course!). As the story goes:The banking business and its complex regulations resemble this old lady. What began as a relatively simple enterprise evolved into the Byzantine industry we know today. To a large extent, it resulted from the first decision to regulate banks as each successive rule tried to patch the unintended consequences created by the last. Swallowing that fly is slowly leading to a horse.It amazes me how poorly we understand banking today. Banks are everywhere. They once populated nearly every corner of America before digitizing. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), more than 80% of U.S. households were fully banked in 2021. Yet, despite our familiarity, centuries of operating history, volumes of books, countless academic papers, and dozens of overseeing regulatory agencies, banking still confuses and scares many.A recent podcast reminded me of this. When the expert guest answered the question of what does a bank do, with deposits, disagreement and discussion broke out. The hosts concluded the interview with the discussion point that  big picture, I feel like in the U.S. we have yet to decide what we want the banking system to actually look like With perspectives like these, banking problems should not surprise us. They cause them!First, deposits is not the primary business of banks. If it were, theyd charge fees for it. Instead, banks pay depositors to access their funds and often provide ancillary services like checking and ATM access
for free
. They assume these costs to acquire capital needed to support their primary business purpose just like a steelmaker pays suppliers for the iron ore it needs to transform.Banks are in the lending (and investing) business, not the money storage business (i.e deposits). They are carry trades, borrowing money in order to lend. Hence, all deposits are legally classified as liabilities and depositors are considered creditors. If banks truly stored funds, rather than borrowed them, theyd hold deposits as legally separated accounts like investment managers and other custodians.In fact, banks didnt always accept deposits. They primarily issued banknotes to support their lending activities until (virtually) outlawed. Only then did deposit-taking grow in importance. Today, banks also fund their operations in the capital markets, issuing commercial paper and corporate bonds and transacting in repo markets, for example. These channels provide banks with low-cost capital that they can subsequently lend at higher rates. They profit from this rate differential known as their net interest margin.Furthermore, banking is not a service, communal activity, or tool for public good. Its a business. Banks exist to generate a profit for their owners. Like all profitable businesses, they improve society as a consequence.Thus, we have nothing to say with respect to how the banking industry
should
look. That is for the bank owners to decide. In a free society dominated by voluntary trade, competition among banks shapes the composition of the industry from the products and services they offer to how they legally organize. What services they should provide, to whom, and for how much; how much capital they should hold and in what forms; what types of loans they should make, to whom, and at what rates get shaped by the trillions of interactions between various banks, capital providers, and customers over time.Yet, banks lack such freedom today. Instead, myriads of regulations guide their every action. Federal agencies like the Federal Reserve (Fed), FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency oversee some. Individual states have their own slate of compliance departments and there are even supranational standard-setters like the Bank for International Settlements. Each one subjects banks to its own guidelines. While often benevolently motivated, their rules can conflict, confusing management teams and exposing banks to legal liabilities and selective enforcement risks. Often, these regulations create the behaviors we despise and fear.While the Feds founding in 1913 represented an escalation of bank supervision, American banks were tightly controlled since inception. The countrys founders debated how to permit the industrys existence, eventually modeling it on Englands with which they were familiar. At the time, Englands banking sector had recently centralized around the Bank of England following the passages of the Bubble Act and Tunnage Act. As a result, American banks required state and federal approvals to operate. As Bray Hammond noted in his Pulitzer prize-winning book on early American banks:Restrictions limited the number of locations banks could have, where they could operate, the types of products and services they could offer, and other aspects. For example, between 1802 and 1826 nearly every bank charter in Massachusetts required that a certain number of loans be agricultural, be secured by mortgage, and run for at least a year. Certain Maryland charter renewals required banks to invest in a company formed to construct a turnpike; Pennsylvania mandated the forty-one banks to lend one-fifth of their capital for one year, to the farmers, mechanics, and manufacturers of their districts. Politics, not enterprise, shaped banks.Even the free banking period in the U.S.from the 1830s to the Feds founding in 1913was a misnomer. Free referred only to the relaxation of requirements to open a bank, not an environment free from regulation. All remained subject to state banking laws. In America, banks never operated with the same autonomy afforded to other industries.The banking industry has always been heavily controlled in America. According to Hammond, the initial restraints only increased through the Civil War. This legacy continues.The trend of increasing controls continues to the current day. Each financial crisis begets a new slate of regulations with which banks must comply devised to cure deficiencies of the preceding regime. However, the existing regulations often caused that which the new ones seek to rectify.For example, I previously noted how banking regulations created the interest rate vulnerability that led to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank (OTC:
SBNY
), Silvergate Bank, and First Republic Bank (OTC:
FRCB
) last year. By incentivizing (and requiring) banks to hold high-quality and liquid assets, they consequentially owned large quantities of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies (such as Fannie Mae). While virtually riskless from a credit-loss perspective, these securities carried large interest rate risks which blew holes in the banks balance sheets as the Fed aggressively raised its policy rate. Regulationsin partmotivated the behaviors that caused the banks to fail.Those regulations were, of course, instituted in response to the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2008. Intended to prevent the types of capital losses experienced then, they instead created unintended vulnerabilities felt in 2023. The GFC resulted from regulations governing banks capital requirements that centralized risks by codifying the credit assessments of a handful of sanctioned rating agencies into banks investment decisions and laws requiring banks to extend questionable, housing-related loans. Those laws, unsurprisingly, were enacted to encourage banks to extend credit to households that they might not have otherwise.The Fed was also created to rectify perceived banking system shortcomings. A slate of financial panics plagued the decades preceding its establishment convincing some that a central bank was needed to bring stability to the volatile sector. Yet, those market failures also resulted from various laws common to the time, such as the prohibition of branching and the requirement to collateralize banknotes with government securities. The former prevented banks from diversifying their credit risks, funding sources, and liquidity measures. The latter curtailed lending activity as the U.S. government repaid its debt leaving banks short on capital to lend. That requirement, of course, came from the National Currency and National Bank acts which were passed to help finance the Civil War.Since the very beginning, weve sought regulatory solutions for regulation-created problems with banks.However, regulations centralize risks thereby increasing systemic fragility in the banking sector. They drive consolidation and incentivize the larger banks to behave in similar ways. Rather than alleviate crises, regulations sow the seeds of the next, larger one. Note that the collapse of just 5 banks made 2023 the second-largest year for them in U.S. history. Many more had to fail in previous episodes to register.The collapse of just 5 banks (3 shown in the graphic above) made 2023 the second-largest year for bank failures in U.S. history. Source: https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/bank-failuresFinancial system stability requires decentralization. That entails fewer and looser, not more and tighter controls. Thus, regulations should be lessened to facilitate risk diversification by permitting a greater number of actors and actions. While potentially bumpy, theres no other way to reduce the risks inherent in banking. More controls can only create greater instability and lead to the sectors eventual demise.The banking industry unnecessarily confuses and scares many. Its complexity stems purely from the growing regulations that saddle it. Absent those, freely transacting customers and capital markets would determine banks products and services, risk management practices, and organizational structures optimizing for profit, customer satisfaction, and value-creation.Unfortunately, we have yet to learn the centralizing dangers that result from bank regulations. By incentivizing banks to consolidate and act similarly, they create unintended systemic risks that manifest as future panics.Contrary to popular narratives, banks have been tightly controlled since Americas founding. Economic and political freedom had just been discovered so modeling the industry on Englands seemed logical. As a result, politics, as much as profits, shape their operations. Yet we blame their failures on enterprise, not the regulations that motivate their behaviors. By seeking regulatory solutions to regulatory-created problems, we virtually guarantee the next crisis.Like the old lady, weve tried swallowing spiders, birds, cats, dogs, goats, and cows to cure our banking ills. Lets hope we learn our lesson before we get to the horse."

Their decisions, announcements, and subsequent press conferences will be closely watched by traders and investors alike. Overall, the market assumes that the global central banks (besides BOJ) will embark on an easing campaign this year. However, the key question is timing: when exactly will the regulators make their first move, and which central bank will be the first to lower its base rate? Octa offers a brief overview of what to expect.BOJ's decision will hit the wires in the early hours of the Asian trading session on 19 March. The market generally expects the central bank to leave its ultra-loose monetary policy unchanged, with the short-term rate target remaining at 0.1% and the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield target staying at around 0%. However, it is a close call. Investors have recently started to price in a higher chance that the BOJ will finally make a policy shift and phase out its decade-long stimulus program. Indeed, there are reasons to expect the Japanese central bank to end negative rates.First, inflation seems to be holding pretty well. The latest Tokyo core Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.5% in February from a year earlier, which is the fastest annual pace since October 2023. At the same time, nationwide core CPI for January came out stronger than expected and has remained above 2.0% for almost two years now (since April 2022). Second, a preliminary survey on the outcome of big firms' wage talks yielded strong results on Friday. This follows the recent decision by Toyota Motor (NYSE:
TM
), which agreed to give factory workers their biggest pay increase in 25 years. Because Kazuo Ueda, the BOJ Governor, has repeatedly signaled that the decision to phase out stimulus depends on wage inflation, the progress made during the year's annual wage talks certainly increases the likelihood that Japan's central bank will finally increase its short-term interest rate target, terminate its bond yield control policy and end the practice of purchasing risky assets such as exchange-traded funds.If the BOJ delivers a hawkish verdict,
USD/JPY
will almost certainly plungepossibly below 147.00. Conversely, should BOJ maintain the status quo, USD/JPY will trend higher or stabilize in the 148.00  150.00 range.RBA will announce its rate decision on 19 March at 3:30 a.m. UTC. At its last meeting, the Australian central bank held its cash rate unchanged at 4.35% and is likely to do so again on Tuesday. As with other central banks, the RBA's main problem is inflation. It remains above the official target and has recently accelerated from 3.4% in December to 3.6% in January. Indeed, during its previous meeting, RBA suggested that a rate hike remains on the table precisely because the growth in consumer prices has not slowed as fast as the regulator hoped it would. Overall, however, the market believes that policy easing will eventually follow. According to the interest rates swaps market data, investors are pricing in roughly 37 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by RBA in 2024, with the first rate cut widely anticipated in August.If the RBA delivers a hawkish verdict,
AUD/USD
will almost certainly rallypossibly above 0.66400. Conversely, should the RBA indicate the preparedness to cut the rates in summer, AUD/USD may trend lower or stabilise in the 0.65200  0.66000 range.The most important event of the week will be the Fed's policy rate decision, which is due on Wednesday at 6:00 p.m. UTC. The U.S. central bank is arguably the most important central bank in the world as it issues the world's reserve currency, the
US dollar
. Therefore, its decisions are always highly anticipated by the market, and, in fact, they often overshadow the decisions of other central banks. This time, however, the Fed's decision is even more important because it will be accompanied by the publication of the latest FOMC Economic Projections report. This report is critical for the market because it includes the dot plot, showing how each Fed member projects future interest rates. The Fed only publishes its projections four times a year so that investors will study them carefully.Last time, 17 of 19 Fed officials projected lower interest rates by end-2024, effectively providing a green light for traders to price in a more aggressive Fed cutting cycle. On the day the Fed telegraphed its previous projections, gold price (
XAU/USD
) rallied more than 2% and then increased by another 3% throughout ten trading sessions. So the importance of the upcoming Fed's decision should not be underestimated.According to Reuters, analysts expect the Fed to maintain its Funds Target Rate in the 5.25  5.50% range. However, the market expects roughly 75 bps worth of rate cuts in 2024. Thus, traders are not positioned to see a hawkish surprise from the Fed. It is a risky position because surprise may be coming as inflation remains sticky. The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) came out higher than expected, while the Producer Price Index (PPI) accelerated to 1.6% in February (from 0.9% in January).Overall, the Fed is likely to err on the side of caution and strike a delicate balance, indicating that while inflation remains a problem, rate cuts in 2024 are not out of the question. Still, investors will probably have to push back their expectations for an early rate cut, and the probability of a 25-bps rate reduction in June may decrease. In this case, XAU/USD will probably correct to the downsidepossibly towards the 2,140  2,130 area.SNB's decisions rarely move the markets sharply. However, the Swiss franc (CHF) may devalue if the SNB announces a rate cut or gives a dovish message on Thursday at 8:30 am UTC. The probability of a 25-bps rate cut currently stands at 33%, but most market participants expect the first rate cut in June. Indeed, SNB is likely to hold the rates steady at its next meeting as monthly inflation accelerated to 0.6% in February. Projecting what would happen to
USD/CHF
after the SNB decision is tough because the Fed's decision will overshadow it. The key levels to watch are 0.87000 on the downside and 0.89000 on the upside.The week will wrap up with the BOE's verdict, due on Thursday at 12:00 p.m. UTC.
GBPUSD
has recently managed to escape its three-month-old trading range and set an eight-month high. However, the pair has been on the downside lately as inflation figures from the U.S. disappointed investors, while the U.K. labor market showed signs of weakness. According to the interest rates swaps market data, investors are pricing in roughly 60 bps worth of rate cuts by BOE in 2024, with the first rate cut anticipated in either June or August.As in the case of SNB, the BOE's decision will be preceded by the Fed's decision, so it is difficult to forecast where GBP pairs will move on Thursday. However, traders are advised to monitor any shift in BOE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) rate voting. Previously, two MPC members voted for a rate hike and one for a rate hike. If the number of doves within the MPC increases, GBP will take a hit."

Investing.com,Crude Oil Adds Fuel to Inflation Fire - Further Monetary Policy Repricing Ahead?,2024-03-19,0.666667,"Stocks rallied on Monday, ahead of an eventful two days. Meanwhile, the market is also busy repricing its rate path for the
Fed
policy, with Fed Futures now seeing fewer than three rate cuts in 2024.This appears to be due to a change in the market outlook for
inflation
, with 1-year inflation breakevens now at their highest since July 2022 and 1-year inflation swaps continuing to move higher today by 1.1 bps to 2.635%.It looks mainly like this results from

has behaved nicely, still below the 4.35% level.Remember that what matters most about the Fed and rates is that the market is repricing the path of monetary policy, and monetary policy works through financial conditions.As the market reprices and adjusts, those conditions will tighten, and the tightening of conditions will impact the stock market.Original Post"
Investing.com,Will Powell Signal Hawkish Shift at Tomorrow's Meeting?,2024-03-19,0.222222,"Analysts are debating if last weeks sticky inflation news is the death knell for a June cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. This much is clear: the recent run of news isnt encouraging for anticipating that a dovish turn for monetary policy is imminent.On Thursday the government reported that
producer price inflation
was hotter than expected. Two days earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
advised
that the
Consumer Price Index
rose more than expected.The one-two punch of these reports has further dented confidence that the Fed will soon start cutting interest rates.There are
signs that the US economic growth is slowing
, but not enough to trigger concern that the Fed needs to cut rates to counteract the threat of rising recession risk, which remains low at the moment.Using Fed funds futures as a proxy for market sentiment indicates a roughly 60% probability that the central bank cuts at its June 12 meeting. Thats down from
70% two weeks ago.Looking to the July FOMC meeting, the
probability
of a rate cut rises by 77%, but a growing number of analysts are skeptical about the timing and, in some cases, the likelihood for a rate cut in 2024.Jim Bianco of Bianco Research agrees:The US Treasury market has been leaning toward that view lately. Notably, the policy-sensitive
2-year yield
closed at 4.73% yesterday (Mar. 18), the highest since December.As a result, this key rate has taken back all of 2024s decline, which was fueled by rate-cut expectations that have increasingly been thrown into doubt as the year unfolded.Although the Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at tomorrows FOMC
meeting
(Mar. 20), investors will be keenly poring over the policy statement, new economic projections, and chairman Powells
press conference

Investing.com,"Gold, EUR/USD Edge Lower Ahead of Fed Rate Decision",2024-03-19,0.666667,"Initially, the gold (XAU) price dropped below 2,150 on Monday but then recovered and settled just slightly below the 2,160 mark as investors repositioned ahead of 5 central bank interest rate decisions.XAU/USD
has been in a short-term bearish trend since 12 March, when the US reported higher-than-expected inflation figures, prompting investors to reconsider their dovish interest rate expectations. Indeed, the probability of a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in June has declined by more than 20% and currently stands at just over 50%. Fundamentally, two confronting factors pull precious metals' prices in different directions. On the one hand, XAU/USD rises because it's considered an inflation hedge, and global inflation remains relatively high. On the other hand, central banks tighten monetary policies when inflation increases, damaging gold's appeal as the asset doesn't yield any passive income. However, geopolitical tensions also push XAU/USD higher, so the pair has managed to reach a record-high level lately.XAU/USD was flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today's historic decision by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to end its policy of negative interest rates had little impact on gold. Likewise, the decision of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to hold the rates steady didn't produce much volatility. Fundamentally, these decisions are bearish for gold, making money more expensive to borrow and raising the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.However, because gold is priced in the US dollar, the main event for gold traders will be the Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday and the release of its latest economic projections. The projections will include the so-called 'dot plot', showing how each Fed member sees the path of US interest rates. Until then, XAU/USD will likely move sideways with a minor bearish tilt. 'Spot gold may retest support at $2,146 per ounce, as a correction from the 8 March high of $2,194.99 looks incomplete,' said Wang Tao, the Reuters analyst.The euro (EUR) lost 0.15% on Monday as it continued to move within a short-term bearish trend triggered by the stronger-than-expected US Producer Price Index report published last Thursday.Fundamentally, after US inflation data was released last week, investors have scaled back their expectations for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in June. However, they continue to expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to start easing monetary policy in the summer. According to interest rate swap market data, the market is pricing in 84 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the ECB and just over 70 bps of rate cuts by the Fed in 2024. Thus,
EUR/USD
declines because investors consider the Fed less dovish than the ECB. The Fed's decision this Wednesday will test investors' interest rate expectations. Traders await the US central bank decision and are unlikely to enter large positions ahead of it. Thus, EUR/USD may continue to move sideways with a minor bearish tilt until the Fed meeting on Wednesday.EUR/USD declined slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. The nearest major target for bears is located in the 1.08100 area. Conversely, bulls have to push the exchange rate back above the 1.09000 level to invalidate the underlying bearish trend. EUR/USD is unlikely to reach any of these levels until the Fed announces its interest rate decision tomorrow.The Japanese yen (JPY) was essentially unchanged on Monday, as traders awaited the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) interest rate decision. However,
USD/JPY
rallied sharply earlier today despite the BOJ having raised its base rate for the first time in 8 years.The decision by the BOJ to end its ultra-loose monetary policy has had a bearish effect on the Japanese yen so far. The Japanese central bank announced it would end the practice of negative rates, abandon the yield curve control (YCC), and discontinue the purchase of risk assets like exchange-traded funds (ETF) and real estate investment trusts. However, the BOJ also gave dovish signals in its monetary policy statement. The regulator said it would keep buying broadly the same amount of government bonds as before and increase purchases if yields rise rapidly.The Japanese yen immediately devalued on the news, with USD/JPY rallying sharply higher, breaking above the critical 150.000 mark. 'It's a classic ""buy the rumor, sell the fact"". I don't think the BOJ was going for the shock and awe approach this time,' said Bart Wakabayashi, the Tokyo branch manager at State Street (NYSE:
STT
). If the market priced in BOJ's decision in advance, then USD/JPY may continue to rally because the divergence in monetary policies between the BOJ and the Federal Reserve (Fed) favors the
US dollar
. However, USD/JPY has already approached a very strong resistance in the 150.000152.000 area. In the past, the BOJ intervened at this level to support JPY.In the short term, USD/JPY may stabilize within 150.000150.600 until tomorrow's Fed policy decision clarifies the future path of US interest rates, impacting the US dollar. According to Reuters, analysts expect the Fed to maintain its Funds Target Rate within the 5.255.50% range. Still, the market expects roughly 70 basis points of rate cuts in 2024. Thus, traders don't expect a hawkish surprise from the Fed. However, a surprise isn't unlikely, as the recent data indicated sticky US inflation. Therefore, if the Fed does give hawkish signals, USD/JPY may break above the critically important 152.000 level. Conversely, a dovish message from the Fed will likely bring USD/JPY below 150.000."
Investing.com,"BoJ Hikes Rates, All Eyes Now on Fed",2024-03-19,0.666667,"We expected  at the start of this year  that March would bring a Fed rate cut. It brought a BoJ rate hike instead.Yes, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) scrapped its negative rate policy, raised the rates from -0.10% to 0%, ditched its YCC policy and ended the purchases of ETF and Japanese real estate investment trusts. However, the bank said that it will continue to purchase sovereign bonds with broadly the same amount and that the policy will remain accommodative for now. The latter caught traders attention more than the rest. While you wouldve clearly expected to see the Japanese 10-year yield and the yen to rally on the back of such a hawkish shift, the
USD/JPY
spiked above 150, the
EUR/JPY
rallied past 163 and the 10-year JGB yield is down by almost 3.5%.The price action suggests a one and done action from the BoJ. Governor Ueda hasnt spoken just yet, but if he doesnt say that the BoJ will continue to hike rates, the yen bulls will apparently not come back. Note that todays decision was supposed to send the yen on a rising path. At this point, I dont see what would make long the yen the best trade of the year.Elsewhere, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) maintained rates unchanged at todays policy meeting, as expected, and the
AUD/USD
fell sharply below the 200-DMA. The
dollar index
, on the other hand, extended gains above the 50-DMA and jumped above the downtrending channel top of February and March. The hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations sent the
US 2-year yield
to 4.75% in the run-up to this weeks Fed meeting. FOMC starts its two-day meeting today and announce their latest decision tomorrow. The Fed is not expected to change the rates at this weeks meeting, hence all eyes are on the dot plot with the expectation of fewer rate cuts this year than previously plotted. The Fed cant start cutting rates when there is no reason to do so: inflation is showing signs of heating up, economic growth is above average, jobs market remains healthy and corporate earnings are robust. There is a chance that we see the median forecast fall to 2 cuts this year from 3 plotted in December. We will also be listening carefully to the Feds plans about its QT: whether they will slow the unwinding of the balance sheet or they wont. I think theyd better not unwind QT to balance out the expansive fiscal stimulus into the November election. Otherwise, inflation will hardly fade away. From a market perspective, a hawkish Fed this week  which we expect to see - we will likely help the
US dollar
and the yields trend higher.While the yields and the dollar were rising, the
S&P 500
was also rising, led by technology stocks.
Nasdaq 100
closed Mondays session 1% higher. Tesla gained more than 6% after it announced a price hike for its Model Y in the US and Europe, effective from this Friday. Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) gained and Google (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) jumped on news that Apple considers integrating Googles Gemini AI into the iPhone. The deal would give Gemini a monstrous reach. For Apple, on the other hand, feelings are mixed. Having AI on iPhones will be fun and should boost iPhone demand. But the fact that the company is looking to use a tool developed by Google is yet another confirmation that theyve missed the AI train and thats not necessarily good news for a technology giant that navigates todays conditions of AI or die.For once, the AI king Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) remained under a shadow yesterday, even after the company unveiled at its GTC conference its new and faster chip that would better handle training and running of AI models. But Nvidia fell 1.77% in the after-hours trading. If the brand-new Blackwell chip didnt trigger a fresh rally, its because the arrival of a new and more powerful chip was already priced in. But if Nvidia bulls didnt take the opportunity to send the price higher, its maybe because the rally is coming to an exhaustion into the $1000 per share markIn energy,
US crude
rallied past the $82pb on Monday on news that Ukraine continued its attacks on Russian refineries. The barrel of US crude flirted with the $83pb and is trading at around $82.50pb at the time of writing. Geopolitical tensions and IEAs forecast that supply will be in deficit this year amid the extension of OPEC supply cuts remain supportive of the bulls. A sustainable rise above $82pb should pave the way to $85pb. The major short-term risk is a hawkish shift from the Fed that could spoil global demand expectations and limit the topside."
Investing.com,What to Expect From the Upcoming US Key Rate Announcement?,2024-03-19,0.333333,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is approachingit will be held on 19 and 20 March. What decision should we expect on key interest rates in the US and what would be the possible scenarios for the
US Dollar
?On 19  20 March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the US Federal Reserve will meet to decide on key interest rates in the US economy. The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged.The Fed began raising the rate in March 2022. By May 2023, it increased from around 0% to 55.25%. In July, the Fed raised the rate by another 25 basis points (bps) to 5.255.5%, the highest since early 2001. In the following meetings, the Federal Reserve left the discount rate per annum unchanged.Economic indicators suggest that US inflation has been falling over the past year, reaching 3.2% by February 2024, mainly due to falling commodity and energy prices. However, the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) suggest that progress has stalled or even reversed. Thus, the CPI during the quarantine period increased by 3.2% compared to the same month last year and by 0.4% compared to the end of the month. The PPI in February jumped by 0.6% relative to Januaryin annual terms, the index rose by 1.6%. The strong labor market in the US also supports the argument in favor of tight monetary policy. For example, the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell by 1,000 last week to 209,000 from the previous week's revised figure of 210,000.The
US Dollar Index
has failed to break the 102.6 support level downwards for the last four days. Now, the price is showing an exit from the narrow range and a bounce from the support level. If the price can close above the 103 mark, we should expect growth to the level of 103.50103.75. We can talk about a downtrend if the price closes below 102.6."
Investing.com,Four Quick Thoughts on Fed Day,2024-03-20,0.333333,"Four fairly quick observations on this Federal Reserve meeting day, not all of which have anything to do with the Fed:1. The FOMC today announced unchanged policy for now on the overnight interest rate, on the pace of QT runoff, and on the collective expectation of the Committee for the number of rate-cuts in 2024 (three, 25bp cuts). But it beats noting that while three cuts is the median expectation, the
mean
expectation dropped substantially. Only one official sees four rate cuts in 2024, compared to five who saw that many or more, as of the December survey. Those four folks moved to three, and one of the three folks moved to just one. Nine of the nineteen dots are for
fewer
than three cuts this year, so we should say this is a closer call than the market seems to think.2. The longer dot plots also show some increase in Committee members expectations for the neutral short-term interest rate (the so-called r-star originally popularized, I think, by Greenspan). The significance of this for investors and traders is that the overnight rate is unlikely to go back to zero unless we get another enormous calamity; the significance for the economy is essentially nil since it is money, and not interest rates, that matter.
Ive written before
about why there are good reasons to think of something like 2-2.25% as the neutral long-run real rate, and so if CPI inflation is expected to be 2.25%-2.5% then something around 4.5% is neutral long-run nominal rate. We are mighty close to that now, so there is no compelling reason to think that interest rates should decline markedly from here. At the short end of the curve, we should eventually be lower  but we need to also keep in mind the growing imbalance in the supply and demand for Treasury paper, which (in the absence of recession) will tend to keep rates on government paper higher than they otherwise would be in equilibrium  and as one consequence, by the way, credit spreads will tend to be
lower
than they otherwise would be for a given level of creditworthiness.3. The Fed clearly believes that the situation in Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and its effect on the banking sector is manageable. If they didnt think so, then they would be hastening to lower rates to ease the refinancing problems that are hitting that sector. I have been reading alarmist analyses saying that the $1 trillion in CRE mortgage maturities due this year will lead to hundreds of bank failures. This falls into the Big Number is Bad and Scary school of analysis. One trillion is a lot of mortgages and that will cripple banking! ExceptLets suppose that 20% of those mortgages go into default  a number more massive than weve ever seen before  and that recovery is 80%. For reference, in the 2008-09 crisis CRE values fell by about 36% according to the Greenstreet Commercial Property Price Index (chart below), and that was against a backdrop of 1%ish inflation. The
nominal
price decline should be less in an environment where underlying inflation is 4% per year, naturally. Since the CRE peak, real values have fallen 31% but nominal values only about 21% on the basis of that index. But the drop from the peak isnt the relevant part. Even the shorter loans now coming due were struck 3-5 years ago, and the drop from
that
level is only about 9%. Plus, the initial loan-to-value levels were not 100%. So (and all of this is just to cuff a rough estimate) a 20% loss when selling out the collateral on a defaulted mortgage seems conservative.Those numbers mean the $1T in mortgage maturities could produce a loss of $40bln (1,000 * 0.2 * 0.2). Thats still a big number, but remember that it is spread over a lot of banks. Suppose that it is spread over
only
2,000 banks, and that the losses have nothing to do with bank size. Then you are looking at losses per bank of $20mm. Thats bad for a small bank, but the losses at a small bank will of course be smaller because they have smaller books. Will that sink hundreds of banks? Only if they are small, fairly insignificant banks.Will some banks fail because they lent too much against commercial real estate which has fallen in value, at too-high loan-to-value ratios, and end up owning property that they cant sell? Almost certainly. But after negotiations and forbearances and the eventual foreclosures  in an environment where the price level is rising 4% per year  I just dont think this is something we should worry about. To be fair, the fact that the Fed is not worried about it is something that makes me worry about it.4. I have been befuddled recently because airfare prices in the CPI have been higher than would be anticipated given the movement in jet fuel prices. Belatedly, I think I know what is going on. The issues with Boeing (NYSE:
BA
) planes has meant that (and I didnt know this) Boeing has greatly reduced its deliveries to airline companies as they sort out the problems with their Max jets. I became aware of this only recently when a Bloomberg story highlighted how Southwest Airlines (NYSE:
LUV
) is cutting capacity and freezing hiring because they arent getting the planes they need. Steady demand and constraints on supply means higher airfares, as I also discovered this week when I was booking a flight to Chicago. Yikes! With jet fuel prices also rising again, this is something to factor into CPI forecasts going forward. Its surely transitory, but it takes a long time to build a plane and in the near-term this is more likely to be solved on the demand side if we have a recession, than on the supply side with a sudden influx of planes.Original Post"

However, updated projections for interest rates and fresh commentary from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may be a wild card, potentially signaling fewer rate cuts and a later start to policy easing than previously anticipated.As such, there will be a lot on the line when the U.S. central bank delivers its monetary policy decision and updated economic projections at 2:00 PM ET on Wednesday afternoon.If you are looking to diversify your risk exposure ahead of the event's volatile trading, you should check out our game-changing AI-powered stock-picking tool.

!The Fed is all but certain to keep the benchmark Fed funds target range between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it has been since last July.Source: Investing.comFOMC policymakers will also release their new forecasts for interest rates and economic growth, known as the ""dot plot"", which will reveal greater signs of the Fed's likely rate trajectory through the rest of 2024 and beyond.In December, the ""dot plot"" showed Fed officials anticipate three interest rate cuts this year and an additional easing of 100 basis points in 2025.All eyes will then turn to Fed Chair Powell, who will hold what will be a closely watched press conference, as investors look for fresh insight into his views on the economy and inflation and how that can affect monetary policy in the months ahead.Despite market expectations for multiple rate cuts this year, traders have begun to adjust their forecasts following a recent batch of hot inflation data, signaling a potential shift in sentiment towards a more cautious approach to monetary policy.After starting the year predicting as many as seven rate cuts, investors now expect just three, with the timing of the first move pushed back from March to June.With that being said, even the odds of a June cut have been falling in recent weeks. At one point Monday, swap contracts that predict decisions by the U.S. central bank showed a less than 50% likelihood that policymakers will deliver their first interest rate cut in June.Source: Investing.comAs of Wednesday morning, the Investing.com
Fed Monitor Tool
pegs the chances of a 25-bps rate cut in June at around 60%, down from over 90% just a few weeks ago.I believe there is a substantial risk the Fed could strike a more hawkish tone than expected as inflation remains well above the central banks 2% target, the economy holds up better than expected, and the labor market remains strong.In addition, the recent pickup in the rate of inflation will prompt Fed officials to downwardly revise their projections to imply two rate cuts this year, from three cuts previously.As such, Powell will attempt to push back against market expectations for an imminent rate cut and reiterate that he only sees cuts happening when the Fed is confident inflation is sustainably moving back to its 2% goal.Bottom line is this is not an environment conducive to cutting interest rates.Contrary to the consensus view, I am of the opinion the Fed could hold off altogether on lowering rates this year as inflation takes longer to return to the Fed's target than many had hoped.After June, the Fed only has four more meetings in 2024: in July, September, November, and December.Taking that into account, it is looking increasing likely that the upcoming U.S. presidential election cycle could interfere with the start of the Feds easing cycle, as the central bank would prefer not to shift to a rate cutting cycle at the last FOMC meeting before the election.That being the case, the Fed could keep rates higher for longer than markets currently anticipate.Any indications or shifts in the Fed's tone during the meeting could trigger significant market movements and investor sentiments. Taking that into consideration, market participants are advised to remain vigilant, exercise caution, and diversify portfolios to hedge against potential market fluctuations.Given markets have moved higher on the prospect of the Fed cutting rates this year, a shift to fewer rate cuts could be considered a threat to the market rally.Be sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.Readers of this article enjoy an extra 10% discount on the yearly and bi-yearly plans with the coupon codes

Investing.com,Gold Trades in Tight Range Ahead of FOMC Meeting,2024-03-20,0.333333,"The
gold
(XAU) price declined by 0.13% on Tuesday as the
U.S. dollar
strengthened ahead of today's Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy rate decision.'Gold is seeing some exhaustion to the upside as the positions moved swiftly over the past week or 2, and now it's taking a bit of a breather as the Fed pricing comes off a bit,' said Ryan McKay, the commodity strategist at TD Securities.In other words, after a swift 1-week rally, which began on 28 February, gold bulls have started to close their long positions as the probability of a 25-basis point (bps) rate cut by the Fed in June has declined.Furthermore, expecting higher gold prices is risky as
XAU/USD
is already near all-time highs, while the latest U.S. macroeconomic data didn't provide reasons for a rate cut. At the same time, a sharp sell-off is also unlikely as safe-haven demand remains strong, and investors still expect global monetary policy to ease in 2024.XAUUSD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the Fed's rate
decision
is a critically important event for gold traders. It is due at 6:00 pm UTC. In addition to the rate decision, which is unlikely to surprise anyone, the Fed will release its FOMC Economic Projections report, including the so-called 'dot plot', showing how each Fed member projects the future path of interest rates.This 'dot plot' is published only 4 times a year, so investors will study the data carefully. Last time, 17 of 19 Fed officials projected lower interest rates by end-2024, and traders priced in a more aggressive rate-cutting cycle. On the day the Fed telegraphed its previous projections, XAUUSD rallied by more than 2% and then increased by another 3% throughout 10 trading sessions.If the FOMC Economic Projections report is viewed as dovish with more rate cuts on the horizon, the gold price will rise, possibly towards 2,200. Conversely, if the report is hawkish and indicates fewer rate cuts, XAUUSD will almost certainly decline, probably towards 2,125. 'Spot gold is biased to break a falling trendline and rise into the $2,175$2,182 range,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.Initially, the
EUR/USD
exchange rate dropped below 1.08400 but later recovered and finished the day essentially unchanged.Yesterday, the German
ZEW Economic Sentiment
report came out stronger than expected, showing an improving investors' sentiment due to the expectations for an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) and positive signs out of China. 'More than 80% of those surveyed anticipate that the ECB will cut interest rates in the next 6 months,' said ZEW President Achim Wambach, adding that this could explain a more optimistic outlook on the construction industry.As a result, EURUSD rallied in the European session yesterday and settled above the important 1.08500. However, the positive effect of the upbeat German statistics will likely be short-lived. The market still expects the ECB to be more dovish than the Fed in 2024, so the fundamental pressure on EURUSD will likely remain bearish if these expectations don't change.EURUSD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today's Fed decision and the FOMC Economic Projections report at 6:00 p.m. UTC will likely trigger above-normal volatility in all USD pairs. The market expects the Fed to leave the rates unchanged, but the main focus will be on the so-called 'dot plot'.The 'dot plot' shows how each Fed member projects the future path of the U.S. interest rates. If the overall monetary policy outlook features fewer rate cuts, EURUSD will likely drop, possibly below 1.08000. Conversely, EURUSD will rally, most likely above 1.09000, if the report is dovish and mentions more rate cuts.The
USD/CAD
lost 0.24% against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday after Statistics Canada showed a smaller-than-expected rise in core inflation.Canada's headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) unexpectedly slowed in February to just 2.8%, Canada's statistics office reported yesterday. Core inflation rose by only 0.1%, the smallest rise in 2 years. The report immediately pushed USDCAD higher as investors started to price in a higher probability of a rate cut from the Bank of Canada (BOC) in June. 'We expect central bankers will sound more dovish in April, thereby setting up a rate-cutting cycle beginning in June,' said Royce Mendes, the head of macro strategy for Desjardins Group.USD/CAD was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Fundamentally, there is no divergence in investors' interest rate expectations for both countries. The market expects the BOC to deliver 75 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts in 2024 and anticipates roughly the same amount of rate reductions by the Federal Reserve (Fed).However, today's Fed decision may change traders' expectations. The Fed will announce its interest rate decision and issue the latest FOMC Economic Projections at 6:00 p.m. UTC. Traders don't expect the Fed to change the base rate. Market participants will closely monitor the so-called 'dot plot' section of the Economic Projections report for any clues about the future changes in interest rates.If the overall monetary policy outlook features fewer rate cuts than was previously expected, USDCAD will likely rally, possibly above 1.36100. Conversely, USDCAD may experience a sell-off, most likely below 1.35000, if the report is dovish and mentions more rate cuts."
Investing.com,The Fed Needs to Step Up and Push Back Hard Against Rate Cut Hopes Today,2024-03-20,0.333333,"It was an implied volatility day yesterday ahead of the
VIX
expiration this morning. The important level for the VIX is 14, and as of yesterday, the VIX closed at 13.8.Vixperiation officially isnt until later on, so the VIX may manage to climb back above 14, but there is an A for effort here on the markets part.But while the VIX was falling, the VIX 1-day was rocketing higher ahead of todays
FOMC meeting
, similar to what we saw ahead of the
CPI
report last week.The main difference is that it hasnt gotten as high yet. It still has time to do that today since the
press conference
doesnt start until 2:30 PM ET.So it would seem possible that today, between 2:35 and 2:45, we will see that volatility crush, which could send the equity market higher.It doesnt mean the market will finish higher; it doesnt mean it will finish lower.It just means that volatility needs to reset, and the higher the IV is when that Press Conference begins, the bigger the volatility crush; how long it lasts depends on the message from the Fed.In the meantime, if the Fed doesnt push back today and show some effort, you really have to wonder what the Fed may be thinking about this point.I think it is the correct call to show fewer rate cuts at this point, given the hotter inflation readings we have seen and the hotter inflation reading we are expected to get, with swaps for March seeing CPI around 3.4% y/y, April around 3.2% y/y, and May around 3.2%.Of course, this assumes that things like
gasoline
do not keep rising. So far this month alone, the average price of gasoline is up more than 5%.So, the Fed can ignore the risk and not push back, and face a bigger problem. I would think it is time for them to step up after what we just went through in 2022.Original Post"
Investing.com,Long Bonds Are at a Tipping Point Ahead of Key Central Bank Decision,2024-03-20,0.444444,"Most investors consider the level of interest rates to be the source of the tipping points that move stocks.Weve found that the velocity of interest rate changes is equally as reliable as absolute levels at identifying tipping point effects on other markets and trends such as stocks,
gold
, housing, currencies, the economy, etc.My colleague Geoff points out:Looking at the Daily chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:
TLT
), support at around $92 has held up.While the price moving averages signify a death cross (bear phase), the momentum indicators in Real Motion show a caution phase.Furthermore, TLT underperforms SPDR
S&P 500
(NYSE:
SPY
), which we consider a risk-on factor.In this chart, Geoff shows you an indicator that helps us anticipate the direction of the stock market based on the bond market.This proprietary indicator is intended to tell you when the stock market will likely react to the bond market in a meaningful way.Currently, the histogram is neutral.Classically, we would expect stocks to fall if the bonds yields rise and TLT breaks 92.00.The interesting part of this equation for us though, is how commodities factor in.One would assume stocks will rise if yields fall and TLT rallies.But what about the bullish trend that is in place for many commodity futures?Yields fall too fast, and commodities will scream higher.While stocks will like lower yields too, we are cautious about any substantial rise in inflation.On the flip side, should yields rise, stocks will fall.However, if commodities have legs based on supply and demand, they may not fall at all.This is why we say long bonds are at a tipping point."
Investing.com,Why Real Assets Deserve a Spot in Long-Term Portfolios,2024-03-20,0.666667,"The sharp runup in US
inflation
in 2021-2022 revived the idea that a so-calledreal assetsportfolio is crucial for asset allocation strategies.But with the peaking of inflation in mid-2022, the outlook has turned murky for a dedicated focus on assets that are expected to benefit from higher pricing pressure.For perspective, lets assume that a real assets portfolio is comprised of four groups via their ETF proxies: commodities (
GSG
), gold (
GLD
), inflation-protected Treasuries (
TIP
) and real estate (
VNQ
).These components are equally weighted and rebalanced at the end of each calendar year. For comparison, the performance chart below also includes a 60/40 US stocks/bonds (
SPY
/
BND
) strategy and the iShares Core Moderate Allocation ETF (NYSE:
AOM
).Well use the start date of Dec. 31, 2019 for a review of how a real assets strategy compares  the eve of what might be called the period of great chaos that eventually unleashed the recent inflation surge.The main takeaway: this real-assets benchmark has done rather well. Notably, it outperformed during the early part of 2022, when markets generally took a heavy blow.Real assets have had a tough time keeping up with a 60/40 strategy recently, but thats because the red-hot US equities market has been so hard to match. A moderate allocation strategy, meanwhile, has had a rough time keeping up.Bold portfolio strategies, in short, have paid off handsomely in recent years.But the question is whether recent history is a reasonable guide.Minds will differ after digesting the second chart below, which moves the start date back to the end of 2012. On that basis, real assets have been a significant laggard while a US 60/40 portfolio has skyrocketed.There are several caveats here, of course, which serve as discussion points that deserve closer review. That starts with the definition of real assets. For some folks, that club should include cryptocurrency, which is now available in ETF form for
Bitcoin
.Theres also the question of whether a tactical overlay for managing a real assets portfolio would improve results vs. the quasi-passive approach reviewed above.Ditto for rethinking an equal weighting system and/or a more granular or expansive opportunity set for tapping into real assets.Perhaps the crucial question is whether inflation will remain a driving force that keeps real assets competitive in the years ahead?There are several ways to think about this, and a strategist cant spend too much on this point for a simple reason: an inflation-driven tailwind, or the absence thereof, will determine a hefty degree of the results for a real-assets strategy in the years ahead.The baseline assumption for asset allocation design is that real assets should be included, and for a good reason: the futures always uncertain, and a medium-/long-term investor shouldnt take the risk of being low on inflation protection.But as the longer-term chart above reminds us, theres a non-trivial possibility that real assets can be a drag on results for an extended time.If inflation continues to moderate, which seems likely in the near term, the value of real assets in a diversified strategy will remain challenged."
Investing.com,QE By a Different Name Is Still QE,2024-03-20,0.333333,"The Fed added Quantitative Easing (QE) to its monetary policy toolbox in 2008. At the time, the financial system was imploding. Fed Chair Ben Bernanke bought $1.5 trillion U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to staunch a financial disaster.The drastic action was sold to the public as a one-time, emergency operation to stabilize the banking system and economy. Since the initial round of QE, there have been four additional rounds, culminating with the mind-boggling $5 trillion operation in 2020 and 2021.QE is no longer a tool for handling a crisis. It has morphed into a policy to ensure the government can fund itself.
However, as we are learning today, QE has its faults. For example, its not an appropriate policy in times of high inflation like we have.That doesnt mean the Fed cant provide liquidity to help the Treasury fund the governments deficits. They just need to be more creative. To that end, rumors are floating around that a new variation of QE will help bridge potential liquidity shortfalls.The Federal government now pays over $1 trillion in interest expenses annually. Before they spend a dime on the military, social welfare, or the tens of thousands of other expenditures, one-third of the governments tax revenue pays for the interest on the $34 trillion in debt, representing deficits of years and decades past.There are many ways to address deficits and overwhelming debt, such as spending cuts or higher taxes. While logical approaches, politicians favor more debt. Lets face it: winning an election on the promise of spending cuts and tax increases is hard. Its even harder to keep your seat in Congress if you try to enact such changes.More recently, the Federal Reserve has been forced to help fund todays deficits and those of years past. We can debate the merits of such irresponsible behavior all day, but for investors, its much more critical to assess how the Fed and Treasury might keep the debt scheme going when QE is not an option.Before spreading rumors about a new variation of QE, lets review the problem. The graph below shows the widening gap between federal spending and tax receipts. The gap between the two lines amounts to the cumulative Federal deficit. Instead of plotting deficit data, we prefer outstanding total federal debt as it better represents the cumulative onus of deficits.The graph below shows the Treasury debt has grown annually for the last 57 years by about 1.5% more than the interest expense. Such may not seem like a lot, but 57 years of compounding makes a big difference.Declining interest rates for the last 40+ years are to thank for the differential. The green line shows the effective interest rate has steadily dropped until recently. Even with the current instance of higher interest rates, the effective interest rate is only 3.00%.The Fed has been increasingly pressed to help the U.S. Treasury maintain the ability to fund its debt at reasonable interest rates. In addition to presiding over lower-than-normal interest rates for the last 30 years, QE helps the cause. By removing Treasury and mortgage-backed securities from the market, the market can more easily absorb new Treasury issuance.Fiscal dominance, as we are experiencing, occurs when monetary policy helps the Treasury fund its debts. Per The CATO Institute:In 2019, before the massive pandemic-related deficits, government spending ramped up over the prior few years due to higher spending and tax cuts. In September 2019, the repo markets strained under the pressure of the growing Treasury demands. The banks had plenty of securities but no cash to lend. For more information on the incident and the importance of liquidity in maintaining financial stability, please read our
article
.When a bank, broker, or investor cant borrow money despite being willing to post U.S. Treasury collateral, that is a clear sign that the banking system lacks liquidity. That is exactly what happened in 2019.The Fed came to the rescue, offering QE and lowering interest rates.Shortly later, in March 2020, government spending blossomed with the pandemic, and the Fed was quick to help. As we shared earlier, the Fed, via QE, removed over $5 trillion of assets from the financial markets. That amount was on par with the surge of government debt.The Fed is mandated to manage policy to achieve maximum employment and stable prices.
Mandated or not, recent experiences demonstrate the Fed has become the de facto lender to the Treasury, albeit indirectly.While Jerome Powell and the Fed might like to help the government meet their exorbitant funding needs with lower interest rates and QE, they are shackled. Higher inflation resulting from the pandemic and fiscal and monetary policies force them to reduce their balance sheet and keep rates abnormally high.Unfortunately, as we wrote in Liquidity Problems, the issuance of Treasury debt rapidly drains excess liquidity from the system.While the Fed hesitates to cut rates or do QE, they may have another trick up their sleeve.The following is based on rumors from numerous sources about what the Fed and banking regulators may do to alleviate funding pressures and liquidity shortfalls.Banks have regulatory limits on the amount of leverage they can employ. The amount is set by the type and riskiness of assets they hold. For instance, U.S. Treasuries can be leveraged more than a loan to small businesses. A dollar of a bank deposit may allow a bank to buy $5 of a Treasury note but only lend $3 to a riskier borrower.The regulatory structure currently recognizes eight Global Systematically Important Banks (GSIB). They are as follows: Bank of America, The Bank of New York, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:
JPM
), Morgan Stanley, State Street (NYSE:
STT
), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:
WFC
).Rumor has it that the regulators could eliminate leverage requirements for the GSIBs. Doing so would infinitely expand their capacity to own Treasury securities. That may sound like a perfect solution, but there are two problems: the banks must be able to fund the Treasury assets and avoid losing money on them.A year ago, the Fed created the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to bail out banks with underwater securities. The program allowed banks to pledge underwater Treasury assets to the Fed. In exchange, the Fed would loan them money equal to the bonds par value, even though the bonds were trading at discounts to par.Remember, since 2008, banks no longer have to book gains or losses on assets unless they are impaired or sold.In a new scheme, bank regulators could eliminate the need for GSIBs to hold capital against Treasury securities while the Fed reenacts some version of BTFP. Under such a regime, the banks could buy Treasury notes and fund them via the BTFP. If the borrowing rate is less than the bond yield, they make money and, therefore, should be very willing to participate, as there is potentially no downside.The Fed still uses its balance sheet in this scheme, but it could sell it to the public as a non-inflationary action, as it did in March 2023 when the BTFP was introduced.The federal governments escalating debt and interest expenses underscore the challenges posed by prolonged deficit spending. The problem has forced the Fed to help the Treasury meet its burgeoning needs. The situation becomes more evident with each passing day.The recently closed BTFP program and rumors about leverage requirements provide insight into how the Fed might accomplish this tall task while maintaining its hawkish anti-inflationary policy stance."

Nikkei
index threw itself back above the 40000 mark and will likely be seeking fresh records. The end of the ETF purchases will do little as the BoJ bought only around 210bn yen worth of assets last year  thats around $150 mio for a USDJPY rate of 140, and they bought none this year.The Japanese companies earnings are robust, they benefit from the US-China tensions, a cheap yen, ultra-lose monetary conditions and corporate governance reforms. On the other hand, the yield differential between Japan and major counterparts remains high enough to prevent the Japanese investors from bringing their money back home in a hurry.In summary, the yen should still appreciate once the BoJ reaction is over, but the selloff in Japanese bonds will likely remain limited and outlook for the Japanese stocks remains positive.Unlike the expectations of the beginning of the year, the Federal Reserve (Fed) will most probably keep the rates unchanged today, update its dot plot and maybe give a hint on whether they will start slowing QT. Given the recent uptick in inflation, strong economic growth, healthy jobs market and robust earnings, we could see some Fed members plot fewer rate cuts for the year and the latter could tilt the median forecast to 2 rate cuts this year from 3 plotted in December.But because that expectation is broadly reflected in the market pricing, there is a chance that a hawkish picture from the dot plot sees limited reaction if the Fed gives any hint that it will slow its balance sheet unwinding.The dollar index is pushing higher into the decision, the 2-year yield is down below 4.70%, the

Investing.com,Volatility Melts as Fed Doubles Down Inflation Gamble,2024-03-21,0.666667,"At this point, one must wonder what the
Fed
is trying to pull off, and it isnt entirely clear to me. It seems like the Fed is taking a big gamble here on
inflation
hotter than not.That isnt my opinion; thats the bond markets opinion based on things like inflation swaps and breakevens.The Fed upgraded its
GDP
forecast, raised its
core inflation
estimates, and left the median dot at 4.6%. But in the meantime, it took rate cuts away from 2025 and raised its long-term run rate to 2.6% from 2.5%. Its just odd once again.It will be interesting to see how the market responds to all of this today once we get past all the changes in positioning. The implied volatility crush that

pretty much happened on schedule, with the big move happening around 2:35 PM ET.This has been a predictable thing for years now, and when it is predictable for this long, it tells you that is all the market is responding to and nothing more. Yesterday, the options market was pricing about 75 to 80 bps moved up or down yesterday, so we finished higher by 89 bps.When you look at the dot plot, you wonder why the yield curve is still inverted at this point. The economy looks pretty healthy.At some point, shouldnt the yield curve steepen? Shouldnt the
2-year rate
fall or the
10-year rate
rise? It is something to watch because, at least right now, the curve steepened by seven bps and seemed to break a downtrend.Meanwhile, 5-year inflation expectations crept higher yesterday and are sitting below resistance with the potential to break out. This is just a spread that measures the difference between the real rate and the nominal rate, and inflation expectations rise as the spread widens.It would seem that if the market believes that the Fed has lost control of inflation, it would be noted by the 5-year breakeven rate breaking out.A breakout, I would think, comes in the form of the 5-year rate rising and the
5-year real yield
rising more slowly.I dont see why nominal rates would go down from here if the Fed is taking away rate cuts from 2025 and 2026 while suggesting higher core inflation and stronger growth.It will be interesting to see how Japan and the
Yen
trade after they reopen from a holiday session yesterday. At 2:33, it was leaked that the BOJ may consider raising rates again in July or October, and that news sent a very sharp reversal in the yen.Of course, this leak from
Nikkei
Asia came perfectly time to coincide with the start of the press conference, and the Yen was tempting fate to break out and rise above the highs seen in the fall.Overall, the Fed dot plot suggests to me that inflation expectations and the nominal rate should be higher, while stocks were just doing what they always do in that 2:30 to 2:45 PM time slot.

Investing.com,Why Fed Still Expects to Cut Rates Despite Sticky Inflation,2024-03-21,0.666667,"The Federal Reserve lifted its outlook for
core PCE
inflation in 2024 but reaffirmed expectations that interest rates will probably fall by the end of the year. Despite the apparent conflict, the market quickly jumped on the bandwagon by bidding up bond prices (and lowering yields) and firming up expectations for rate cuts via the implied forecast in Fed funds futures.The policy-sensitive
2-year Treasury yield
fell for a second day on Wednesday (Mar. 20), dropping to 4.59%, a middling level relative to the range of the past month. The latest decline coincided with yesterdays widely anticipated Fed announcement that it would leave its target rate unchanged at a 5.25%-to-5.50% range.The markets main focus was on restated expectations that rate cuts are still on the table for later this year. Fed Chairman Powell remained cautious on the path ahead for monetary policy, advising:Nonetheless, revised expectations of Fed officials, summarized in the so-called dot plot chart shown below (courtesy of The New York Times), indicate that the central bank sees its target rate falling to roughly 4.6% by the end of 2024 from the current 5.25%-to-5.50% range.The Fed funds futures market lifted the estimated probability for the first rate cut in June to an implied 70%.Despite the dovish bias, the Fed slightly raised its expectations for core PCE inflation this year to 2.6% from Decembers 2.4% estimate. The central bank also increased its 2024 economic growth projection to 2.1% from the previous 1.4%, based on an annual
GDP
forecast.Stronger growth and higher core inflation dont immediately suggest a softer policy response, but Powell didnt push back on the idea that the central bank would begin easing later in the year.Yet the recent run of sticky inflation news leaves room for thinking that the Fed might have become more cautious about cutting rates in recent weeks. But as a reporter at The Wall Street Journal observes
,Despite the ongoing bias favoring rates cuts, the macro data still suggests that the timing for the start of policy easing could be delayed.Nonetheless, the crowds still expecting that June will mark the arrival of the first rate cut. The obvious caveat: A lot of economic data will be published between now and June and so its still an open debate if the incoming numbers will support the case for a June rate cut."

Investing.com,Gold Sets a Record High on Dovish Fed Statements; Euro Rises on US Dollar Weakness,2024-03-21,0.555556,"The gold (XAU) price surged by 1.33% on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve (Fed) maintained its previous projection of 3 rate cuts in 2024.As expected, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged in the 5.255.50% range. However, the monetary policy statement and the FOMC Economic Projections report indicated that central bank officials continue to believe that inflation will subside, giving the opportunity to deliver 3 rate cuts in 2024. 9 of 19 FOMC members see the US policy rate above 4.6% median forecast for 2024, and only 1 member projected 4 rate cuts in 2024. The market considered the report as dovish and bullish for gold, pushing the probability of a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut in June towards 71%, a significant increase from just over 50% before the data release.XAU/USD
jumped higher in the Asian trading session but lost some gains in the early European trading hours. The gold is now trading near all-time highs again, and the risk of a downward correction increases. Any macroeconomic report suggesting that the US economy remains resilient and price pressure stays elevated could trigger a major sell-off in XAU/USD, as dovish interest rate expectations have been overly priced in. Thus, traders should focus on the release of a series of Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) today. The US PMIs will be published at 1:45 p.m. UTC. Higher-than-expected figures will have a bearish impact on XAU/USD, decreasing chances for soon rate cuts. Conversely, lower-than-expected numbers may push XAU/USD slightly higher.The euro (EUR) gained 0.49% on Wednesday as the
US dollar
declined due to the dovish monetary policy outlook released by the Federal Reserve (Fed).The Fed confirmed its previous outlook for 3 interest rate cuts this year in yesterday's highly anticipated policy statement. Furthermore, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the press conference that the central bank's policy rate has now peaked, suggesting that the next move can only be a rate cut. However, he didn't explicitly mention when exactly the rate cut would come. The market assumes the first rate reduction will arrive in June, considering a 71% probability of a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut. Similarly, investors expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to deliver the first rate cut around the same time. Fundamentally, there is little difference between the Fed and the ECB regarding their monetary policy outlooks. Thus,
EUR/USD
may continue to move sideways in the medium term within a broad 1.070001.10000 range.EUR/USD was rising slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions because investors' interest rate expectations for both the US and the eurozone are essentially the same. Thus, only the upcoming data may shift the balance. Today, traders should focus on the series of Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs). The eurozone PMI will be published at 9:00 a.m. UTC, and the US PMI is due at 1:45 p.m. UTC. Strong figures above 50 typically indicate that the economy is expanding, while numbers below 50 suggest that the economy may be contracting. If the eurozone PMI figures are higher than expected or higher than the US PMI numbers, EUR/USD will likely rise above 1.09500. However, lower-than-expected results will put downward pressure on the pair.The British pound (GBP) surged 0.5% on Wednesday as dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate projections overshadowed the decline in U.K. inflation figures.Yesterday was very eventful for GBP traders as the U.K. released many important macroeconomic reports, while the Fed announced its interest rate decision and published the latest FOMC Economic Projections. The U.K. data showed that British inflation slowed in February, keeping high chances that the Bank of England (BOE) will start cutting interest rates in the upcoming months. 'Inflation numbers do not change our view that the MPC is likely to convey the message that it has an eye on easing policy rates this year, but the hurdle to do so has not yet been overcome,' said Ellie Henderson, an economist with Investec.Investors slightly increased bets that the BOE will begin to cut interest rates in August, which should have put bearish pressure on the British pound. However, the dovish message from the Fed officials sent the US dollar lower and pushed
GBP/USD
higher. Investors now expect the US central bank to begin the rate-cutting cycle in June and deliver around 80 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts in 2024 compared to the expected 65 bps of rate reductions by the BOE. Thus, the fundamental pressure on GBP/USD remains bullish for now.GBP/USD was rising during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today will be another eventful day for GBP traders due to the U.K. Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) at 9:30 a.m. UTC and the BOE rate decision at 12:00 p.m. UTC. Arguably, the BOE's decision, its monetary policy statement, and members' voting results should have a bigger impact on the British pound. Therefore, the PMI is unlikely to produce a noticeable reaction in the market as traders will be waiting for the central bank's statement. Traders should monitor any shift in the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) rate voting. Previously, 2 MPC members voted for a rate hike and 1 for a rate cut. GBP will likely decline if the number of doves within the MPC increases."
Investing.com,ECB Vs. Fed,2024-03-21,0.333333,"The Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting went better than many expected. The Fed left interest rates unchanged as planned, but Chair Jerome Powell repeated that the rate cuts will begin sometime this year and that it would be appropriate to slow the pace of QT fairly soon. There is no particular time regarding when the Fed will start giveaways, but we know that the recent uptick in inflation, the strong NFP figures, or the above-target growth dont seem to be a concern for most Fed members. 10 of them plotted three or more rate cuts for this year, and 9 of them plotted two rate cuts or fewer. The median forecast is three rate cuts, unchanged from the December plot. The only hawkish tilt was for 2025. In 2025, the Fed members expect three cuts and not four. Voila.Yesterdays Fed decision was such a relief for the market, where the fear of seeing the Fed turn hawkish was reigning. The probability of a June rate cut spiked past 75% after the meeting from around 60% on Monday. The
US 2-year yield
sank below 4.60% after having approached the 4.80% earlier this week. The
10-year yield
retreated below 4.30%, the
dollar index
gave back last weeks gains, and returned to February to March descending channel. Equities soared, of course, the
S&P 500
rallied past the 5200 mark and closed at a fresh ATH, while
Nasdaq
jumped more than 1% as well following such a dovish surprise from the Fed.In Europe, mood was much less cheery, as the 11% plunge of Kering, the owner of Gucci, raised questions regarding the health of the rest of the European luxury stocks. Kering (EPA:
PRTP
) revealed that Gucci sales will fall 34% in Asia and about 20% worldwide versus a 4% dip predicted by analysts. Gucci makes up around 60% of the companys total profit, hence Kering now expects global sales to fall by around 10% this quarter, versus only 3% penciled in by analysts. No wonder the news is quite a shocker for Kering and a strong warning for other luxury brands like LVMH, Hermes and Richmond. LVMH lost more than 1.50% yesterday, while Hermes remained near flat.On the central bank front, European Central Bank (ECB) head Christine Lagarde didnt enchant Europeans when she said that the ECB cant commit to rate cuts beyond a first cut in June. She repeated that they will know a bit more by April and a lot more by June. The
EUR/USD
jumped on the back of more dovish Fed and more hawkish ECB news, should extend gains above the 1.10 level and steady within 1.10/1.12 range as the US dollar should extend losses across the board, unless a big surprise derails the dovish Fed expectations. For now, there is no reason to doubt the Feds determination to cut in summer.Today, its the Bank of Englands (BoE) turn to announce decision. Yesterdays softer-than-expected inflation figures and last weeks softer-than-expected jobs data are supportive of the BoE doves. Of course, the BoE is not expected to change rates today, but the MPC members votes will be the key takeaway from todays announcement. If more MPC members vote in favor of a rage cut, we will likely see the BoE rate cut expectations pulled earlier this summer. For now, a 25bp cut is fully priced in for August  unchanged after yesterdays inflation report. Cable jumped yesterday despite a soft inflation report as the selloff in the US dollar weighed heavier on the balance. And the same reasoning than with the EUR/USD applies here. Cable is set to extend gains further, and the bulls could eye a rise to 1.30 if the
US dollar
remains under pressure on the back of strongly dovish Fed expectations.The Swiss National Bank (SNB) also gives its policy decision today. The Swiss will likely follow in the footsteps of the ECB, but they could act slightly earlier than European peers given that inflation is now below target and letting the franc giveaway some strength wouldnt be bad for the Swiss economy and exporters  especially after the Kerings warning that Asian customers are not necessarily hungry for expensive European brands right now. The
EUR/CHF
rebounded more than 4% since the beginning of the year, but the pair has not even reached the minor 23.6% Fibonacci retracement on 2021 to 2024 selloff - the period where the SNB decided to let the franc strengthen to fight inflation. Therefore, there is a good upside opportunity for the EUR/CHF, if of course, the SNB remains convinced that inflation in Switzerland is under control. For now, it is.Reddit will start trading on NYSE today after having raised $748 million priced at $34 per share  which is the top marketed range. Fundamentally, Reddit is not Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
)  huh  they havent had a profitable year since the 2005 launch and the user growth has stalled near 500 mio for the past three years. Therefore, Redditers should give a supportive hand to make buzzy headlines. Note that the weather conditions are ideal for a first day facing the public  especially for speculative trades. The Fed has been accommodative, risk appetite is strong and there are no clouds in the sky. So, the Redditers could enjoy the ride."
Investing.com,4 Key Takeaways From the Fed Meeting,2024-03-21,0.333333,"Four fairly quick observations on this Federal Reserve meeting day, not all of which have anything to do with the Fed:The FOMC today announced unchanged policy for now on the overnight interest rate, on the pace of QT runoff, and on the collective expectation of the Committee for the number of rate-cuts in 2024 (three, 25bp cuts). But it beats noting that while three cuts is the median expectation, the
mean
expectation dropped substantially.Only one official sees four rate cuts in 2024, compared to five who saw that many or more, as of the December survey. Those four folks moved to three, and one of the three folks moved to just one. Nine of the nineteen dots are for
fewer
than three cuts this year, so we should say this is a closer call than the market seems to think.The longer dot plots also show some increase in Committee members expectations for the neutral short-term interest rate (the so-called r-star originally popularized, I think, by Greenspan). The significance of this for investors and traders is that the overnight rate is unlikely to go back to zero unless we get another enormous calamity; the significance for the economy is essentially nil since it is money, and not interest rates, that matter.Ive written before
about why there are good reasons to think of something like 2-2.25% as the neutral long-run real rate, and so if CPI inflation is expected to be 2.25%-2.5% then something around 4.5% is neutral long-run nominal rate. We are mighty close to that now, so there is no compelling reason to think that interest rates should decline markedly from here.At the short end of the curve, we should eventually be lower  but we need to also keep in mind the growing imbalance in the supply and demand for Treasury paper, which (in the absence of recession) will tend to keep rates on government paper higher than they otherwise would be in equilibrium  and as one consequence, by the way, credit spreads will tend to be
lower
than they otherwise would be for a given level of creditworthiness.The Fed clearly believes that the situation in Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and its effect on the banking sector is manageable. If they didnt think so, then they would be hastening to lower rates to ease the refinancing problems that are hitting that sector. I have been reading alarmist analyses saying that the $1 trillion in CRE mortgage maturities due this year will lead to hundreds of bank failures. This falls into the Big Number is Bad and Scary school of analysis. One trillion is a lot of mortgages and that will cripple banking! ExceptLets suppose that 20% of those mortgages go into default  a number more massive than weve ever seen before  and that recovery is 80%. For reference, in the 2008-09 crisis CRE values fell by about 36% according to the Greenstreet Commercial Property Price Index (chart below), and that was against a backdrop of 1%ish inflation.The
nominal
price decline should be less in an environment where underlying inflation is 4% per year, naturally. Since the CRE peak, real values have fallen 31% but nominal values only about 21% on the basis of that index. But the drop from the peak isnt the relevant part.Even the shorter loans now coming due were struck 3-5 years ago, and the drop from
that
level is only about 9%. Plus, the initial loan-to-value levels were not 100%. So (and all of this is just to cuff a rough estimate) a 20% loss when selling out the collateral on a defaulted mortgage seems conservative.Those numbers mean the $1T in mortgage maturities could produce a loss of $40bln (1,000 * 0.2 * 0.2). Thats still a big number, but remember that it is spread over a lot of banks. Suppose that it is spread over
only
2,000 banks, and that the losses have nothing to do with bank size. Then you are looking at losses per bank of $20mm. Thats bad for a small bank, but the losses at a small bank will of course be smaller because they have smaller books. Will that sink hundreds of banks? Only if they are small, fairly insignificant banks.Will some banks fail because they lent too much against commercial real estate which has fallen in value, at too-high loan-to-value ratios, and end up owning property that they cant sell? Almost certainly. But after negotiations and forbearances and the eventual foreclosures  in an environment where the price level is rising 4% per year  I just dont think this is something we should worry about. To be fair, the fact that the Fed is not worried about it is something that makes me worry about it.I have been befuddled recently because airfare prices in the CPI have been higher than would be anticipated given the movement in jet fuel prices. Belatedly, I think I know what is going on. The issues with Boeing (NYSE:
BA
) planes has meant that (and I didnt know this) Boeing has greatly reduced its deliveries to airline companies as they sort out the problems with their Max jets.I became aware of this only recently when a Bloomberg story highlighted how Southwest Airlines (NYSE:
LUV
) is cutting capacity and freezing hiring because they arent getting the planes they need. Steady demand and constraints on supply means higher airfares, as I also discovered this week when I was booking a flight to Chicago.Yikes! With jet fuel prices also rising again, this is something to factor into CPI forecasts going forward. Its surely transitory, but it takes a long time to build a plane and in the near-term this is more likely to be solved on the demand side if we have a recession, than on the supply side with a sudden influx of planes.Original Post"
Investing.com,FOMC Aftermath,2024-03-21,0.666667,"The
FED
kept rates unchanged and essentially suggested 3 rate cuts on the table for 2024.Both the commodities and equities markets took that as a sigh of relief.SPY
made new all-time highs and
gold
and gold miners flew.For 2025, the FED sees the jobs rate as holding steady at 4.1%.They see inflation dropping to 2.2% as measured by the PCE numbers.And they see the Fed Funds rate dropping significantly by 2026 and in the longer run.However, the FED is committed to a 2% inflation rate.And the most interesting part-Powell said that there could be seasonal effects in inflation data.Sounds like many words to say one word- transitory.Powell is watching the labor market and will become more dovish if the unemployment rate rises.He feels confident that the policy rate has peaked.But also wants us to understand that higher for longer is not off the table.Some analysts took the minutes as a more hawkish FED, while the initial market reaction interpreted the meeting as dovish.Powell did a great job pandering to both doves and hawks.Our focus remains the same as far as the next direction.Junk Bonds-they rallied (

Investing.com,EUR/USD Swings Wildly Post Key Central Bank Decisions,2024-03-22,0.333333,"Key Central Banks' decisions have dictated the financial markets this week. The Bank of Japan took a
historic step
by raising interest rates by a symbolic 0.1%, the first increase since 2007.However, the market expected a more significant move, causing the
Japanese yen
to weaken further.Meanwhile, the
Federal Reserve
and the
Bank of England
left rates unchanged as anticipated. Surprisingly, the
Swiss National Bank
decided to cut interest rates, leading to the
Swiss franc
's weakening.The Fed's meeting was closely watched, but no pivot date was announced, leaving the
EUR/USD
pair in uncertainty.Although rates were expected to remain unchanged, the overall sentiment was dovish due to the Fed's announcement of a slower reduction in its balance sheet. While there's no official confirmation, the market speculates a pivot in June.As a result, the currency pair experienced volatility, rebounding strongly after the meeting but retracing during the following session. Ultimately, the rate remained almost unchanged from Wednesday, giving a neutral impression.If selling pressure persists, the next target is the support level around 1.08. Breaking this level could lead to a move towards the demand zone near 1.07.The biggest surprise this week was the Swiss National Bank's decision to cut interest rates by 25 bps, with the market consensus anticipating no move.This is not the first time the SNB has surprised the market. These types of unsignaled decisions are not uncommon with the Swiss monetary policy.The main argument is inflation remaining on target and its projection, which assumes stabilization in the coming years.In the coming months, inflation dynamics will invariably remain key, and in a situation where we see continued disinflation, it is not unlikely that we will see another previously unsignaled reduction.Yesterday's meeting of the Bank of England did not bring much change in terms of current monetary policy, as confirmed primarily by the results of the vote: 8 members in favor of leaving current levels and 1 in favor of cuts.This statement clearly reflects the board members' stance on current policy. It suggests that the BOE is unlikely to take proactive measures, and any rate cuts may only occur after similar actions by the ECB and the Fed.***Take your investing game to the next level in 2024 with ProPicksInstitutions and billionaire investors worldwide are already well ahead of the game when it comes to AI-powered investing, extensively using, customizing, and developing it to bulk up their returns and minimize losses.Now, InvestingPro users can do just the same from the comfort of their own homes with our new flagship AI-powered stock-picking tool: ProPicks.With our six strategies, including the flagship ""Tech Titans,"" which outperformed the market by a lofty 1,183% over the last decade, investors have the best selection of stocks in the market at the tip of their fingers every month.Subscribe here and never miss a bull market again

Investing.com,"S&P 500 Overbought, US Dollar on Verge of Breakout",2024-03-22,0.666667,"Since the beginning of March, the
S&P 500
has been undergoing a nice consolidation, which passed between the day before yesterday and yesterday.However, the index did manage to hit the upper trend line, which has been respected since February 12.It also trades one full bar above the upper Bollinger band, which hasnt happened often during this rally and is generally in an overbought condition.By the looks of the chart, I cant see any other time that has happened going back to October. It is merely an observation and not predictive of anything, but again, I would think it serves as an overbought indication.The
dollar
was also very strong yesterday, especially against the
Swiss franc
and the
British pound
.So, yet again, the
dollar index
is approaching that resistance level at 104.25, which has been very difficult to breach.One would think that given the stronger US data, the move to cut rates by the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank of Englands dovish tone, the dollar would break out and push higher. But we have to wait to see what develops here.The
Nikkei
has rallied aggressively following the BOJs
decision
to raise rates and end yield curve control.That is mainly because the yen has weakened. After all, the BOJ gave no clarity as to when it would consider raising rates again.So this week had four central banks, all with reasonably timid policies and stances, and it strikes me as odd.Most notably that of the Fed, where the market is saying that the Feds view on inflation is wrong. We are now at the highest level on the 5-year inflation breakeven in a year.The chart shows that the 5-year inflation break-even trend has been steadily rising since mid-December, around the time of that FOMC meeting. One would think that if the policy were indeed as restrictive as the Fed believes, this would not happen.So, its no wonder the
XLE
is hitting resistance for the fifth time since June 2022.If the Fed is going to let inflation run hot and the market suggests inflation is going higher, then it would make sense for energy prices to go higher and the energy sector to go higher as well.It might even make sense for the
metals and mining

Investing.com,Fed Stance Explained? US Growth Could Slow Further as Job Market Rebalances,2024-03-22,0.555556,"The US economy remains on track to post a moderate growth rate in the upcoming first-quarter
GDP
report, but the expansion shows signs of slowing.Output for the January-through-March period is estimated at a 2.0% increase (seasonally adjusted real annual rate), based on the median for a set of nowcasts compiled by CapitalSpectator.com.If correct, the moderate increase will mark another downshift in growth from Q4s strong 3.2% advance.A 2.0% rise in GDP is comfortably above the level that would ring alarm bells for recession risk, but todays revised median nowcast marks another downshift for the current quarter.The previous Q1 median estimate: 2.1%,
posted on Mar. 15
. At the
end of February
, the median nowcast was higher still at 2.3%.Although the recent downside revisions have been slight, the directional bias suggests that economic activity is losing momentum, albeit on the margins.The key question is whether the softer trend will stabilize at or near current levels or deteriorate further in the months ahead.A similar profile of slightly softer growth was highlighted in yesterdays PMI survey data. The US
PMI Composite
Output Index (a GDP proxy) eased to 52.2 in March, down slightly from Februarys 52.5.Both readings are modestly above the neutral 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The latest update still signals a solid monthly improvement in business activity at US companies, advises S&P Global, which publishes the PMI data.Perhaps the Federal Reserves inclination to cut rates later this year, despite recent sticky inflation news, is a recognition that economic momentum is easing and that the current policy rate is too high to keep output humming.Despite the softer trend in US economic activity, the odds remain low that stall speed or worse is a near-term risk. Thats partly due to the ongoing resilience of the US labor market, a key economic factor.Yesterdays update on weekly
jobless claims
, for instance, highlights the ongoing positive trend as new filings for unemployment benefits dipped, printing near a multi-decade low."

Investing.com,"Retirement Crisis Looms as Social Security, Medicare, Corporate Pensions Tank",2024-03-22,0.666667,"It is long past the time that we face the fact that

Social Security is facing a retirement crisis. In June 2022, we touched on this issue, discussing the stark realities confronting Social Security.Note the last sentence.When President Roosevelt first enacted social security in 1935, the intention was to serve as a safety net for older adults. However, at that time, life expectancy was roughly 60 years. Therefore, the expectation was that participants would not be drawing on social security for very long on an actuarial basis. Furthermore, according to the Social Security Administration, roughly 42 workers contributed to the funding pool for each welfare recipient in 1940.Of course, given that politicians like to use government coffers to buy votes, additional amendments were added to Social Security to expand participation in the program. This included adding domestic labor in 1950 and widows and orphans in 1956. They lowered the retirement age to 62 in 1961 and increased benefits in 1972. Then politicians added more beneficiaries, from disabled people to immigrants, farmers, railroad workers, firefighters, ministers, federal, state, and local government employees, etc.While politicians and voters continued adding more beneficiaries to the welfare program, workers steadily declined. Today, there are barely 2-workers for each beneficiary. As noted by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation:As we will discuss, the collision of demographics and math is coming to the welfare system.The new
Financial Report of the United States Government
(February 2024) estimates that the financial position of Social Security and Medicare are underfunded by roughly $175 Trillion. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellin signed the report, but the chart below details the problem.The obvious problem is that the welfare systems liabilities massively outweigh taxpayers ability to fund it. To put this into context, as of Q4-2023, the
GDP
of the United States was just $22.6 trillion. In that same period, total federal revenues were roughly $4.8 trillion. In other words, if we applied 100% of all federal revenues to Social Security and Medicare, it would take 36.5 years to fill the gap. Of course, that is assuming that nothing changes.However, therein lies the actuarial problem.All pension plans, whether corporate or governmental, rely on certain assumptions to plan for future obligations. Corporate pensions, for example, rely on certain portfolio return assumptions to fund planned employee retirements. Most pension plans assume that portfolios will return 7% a year. However, a vast difference exists between
average returns
and 
compound returns
as shown.Social Security, Medicare, and corporate pension plans face a retirement crisis. A shortfall arises if contributions and returns dont meet expectations or demand increases on the plans.For example, given real-world return assumptions,
pension funds SHOULD lower their return estimates to roughly 3-4% to potentially meet future obligations and maintain some solvency.
However, they cant make such reforms because
plan participants
wont let them. Why? Because:Social Security and Medicare face the same intractable problem. While there is ample warning from the Trustees that there are funding shortfalls to the plans, politicians refuse to make the needed changes and instead keep adding more participants to the rolls.However, all current actuarial forecasts depend on a steady and predictable pace of age and retirement. But that is not what is currently happening.The single biggest threat that faces all pension plans is demographics. That single issue can not be fixed as it takes roughly 25 years to grow a taxpayer. So, even if we passed laws today that required all women of birthing age to have a minimum of 4 children over the next 5 years, we would not see any impact for nearly 30 years. However, the problem is running in reverse as fertility rates continue to decline.Interestingly, researchers from the Center For Sexual Health at Indiana University put forth some hypotheses behind the decline in sexual activity:The apparent problem with less sex and non-heterosexual identities is fewer births.No matter how you calculate the numbers, the problem remains the same. Too many obligations and a demographic crisis. As noted by official OECD estimates, the aging of the population relative to the working-age population has already crossed the
point of no return.To compound that situation, there has been a surge in retirees significantly higher than estimates. As noted above, actuarial tables depend on an expected rate of retirees drawing from the system. If that number exceeds those estimates, a funding shortfall increases to provide the required benefits.The decline in economic prosperity discussed previously is caused by excessive debt and declining income growth due to productivity increases. Furthermore, the shift from manufacturing to a service-based society will continue to lead to reduced taxable incomes.This employment problem is critical.By 2025, each married couple will pay Social Security retirement benefits for one retiree and their own familys expenses.
Therefore, taxes must rise, and other government services must be cut.Back in 1966, each employee shouldered
$555 of social benefits. Today, each employee has to support more than $18,000 in benefits.
The trend is unsustainable unless wages or employment increases dramatically, and based on current trends, such seems unlikely.The entire social support framework faces an inevitable conclusion where wishful thinking will not change that outcome.
The question is whether elected leaders will make needed changes now or later when they are forced upon us.For now, we continue to
Whistle past the graveyard
of a retirement crisis."
Investing.com,"Gold, EUR/USD Drop on US PMI Figures; Bitcoin Falls After Unexpected SNB Rate Cut",2024-03-22,0.666667,"The gold (XAU) price dropped by 0.24% on Thursday as traders took profit on their long positions after a very strong 3-week rally.XAU/USD
has risen by more than 10% since mid-February, but the bullish trend seems to be slowing as the gold price failed to hold above the pivotal 2,195 level.Still, the overall sentiment in the gold market is decisively bullish, as almost all major central banks plan to reduce interest rates in 2024, while safe-haven flows remain strong due to geopolitical risks.The main risk for gold is that investors' interest rate expectations may begin to change. Indeed, yesterday's higher-than-expected US Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) figures triggered a downward correction in gold because data indicating a strong economic expansion decreases the chances of interest rate cuts.XAU/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the economic calendar is rather uneventful. However, Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, will give a speech at 1:00 p.m. UTC. His remarks may trigger some volatility in the market, but he will unlikely say anything new.The euro (EUR) lost 0.53% on Thursday as the US Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) report came out better than expected, and the figures were substantially higher than the eurozone's data.After rising briskly due to the dovish interest rate projection by the Federal Reserve (Fed) on Wednesday,
EUR/USD
declined yesterday. The latest economic data indicated that the US economy was doing much better than the eurozone's, suggesting that interest rates in the US will eventually remain higher compared to Europe. Thus, investors are starting to favor the
US dollar
again. According to interest rate swap market data, traders are pricing in 90 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) and only 80 bps worth of reductions by the Fed in 2024. Furthermore, yesterday's Swiss National Bank (SNB) decision to cut the rates may have had an additional bearish impact on the euro.EUR/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders will receive more clues on the health of the eurozone economy when Germany publishes its Ifo Business Climate report at 9:00 a.m. UTC. Better-than-expected figures will likely trigger a minor upward correction in EUR/USD but probably no higher than 1.08700. Conversely, worse-than-expected data will put an additional bearish pressure on the pair, potentially pulling towards 1.08000.On Thursday,
Bitcoin
(BTC) declined due to the strengthening US dollar and lost some gains made on Wednesday when the dovish Federal Reserve's outlook pushed the pair higher.The US dollar strengthened after an unexpected rate cut of 25 basis points by the Swiss central bank, and this may have influenced the
BTC/USD
decrease. This move negated the significant decrease the US dollar experienced on Wednesday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed a dovish stance on the monetary policy as US inflation exceeded the forecast. Thus, the strengthening of the US dollar on Thursday could be attributed to investors' anticipation that some major central banks might start cutting rates before the Fed does, as pointed out by the macro analyst Michael Kao.Bernstein, a research and brokerage firm, adjusted its year-end prediction for Bitcoin's price, raising it from 80,000 to 90,000 due to positive changes in market dynamics and the recent upward trend in cryptocurrency. Analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra noted that several factors support an optimistic outlook on BTC: strong inflows into exchange-traded funds, low miner leverage, and high network transaction fees this cycle. They believe these conditions have diminished the impact of halving on miners, allowing for sustained dollar revenues.Although Bitcoin has dropped from its peak of over 73,000 last week, many analysts still predict a significant recovery for the cryptocurrency by the end of the year.BTC/USD rose slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Currently, Bitcoin enthusiasts have managed to overturn the decline observed on 19 March. Optimistic market participants are now seeing 73,800 as a potential short- to medium-term target."
Investing.com,"BoE Follows Fed, Holds Rates Steady",2024-03-22,0.333333,"Both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, with future cuts hinted at based on inflation progress.After todays announcement by the Bank of England to hold key rates steady, both the BoE and the Federal Reserve have decided to maintain their current rates, with the BoE holding steady at 5.25% and the Fed keeping its benchmark rate in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%.
This decision comes as both central banks observe encouraging signs of inflation easing, although they remain cautious about prematurely lowering borrowing costs.Governor Andrew Bailey of the BoE noted that while inflation is moving in the right direction, it is not yet time for rate cuts. Similarly, Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the challenge of persistent inflation but expressed confidence in eventually achieving the Feds 2% inflation goal.The decisions made by the BoE and the Fed were influenced by recent inflation data, with the BoE responding to a sharp drop in inflation to 3.4%, the lowest rate since 2021, and the Fed observing a slight increase in February inflation to 3.2% on an annual basis.
Despite maintaining current interest rates, both central banks forecast potential rate cuts within the year, contingent on continued progress toward their inflation targets.The markets reacted positively to the announcements, with the
FTSE 100 index
rising by 1.5% and the
S&P 500
and
Dow Jones Industrial Average
also gaining following the Feds announcement.The BoEs decision led to a fall in the sterling against the dollar, and traders fully priced in three 0.25 percentage point cuts for the year, with a 75% likelihood that rate cuts could begin by June. Most Federal Open Market Committee members also projected three rate cuts later in 2024.While high borrowing costs remain due to previous rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation, the prospect of future rate cuts has instilled optimism in the markets.
The BoE and the Fed continue to monitor inflation data and economic indicators, and their cautious approach to lowering borrowing costs reflects a commitment to ensuring sustainable economic growth and price stability in the long run. However, their approach also hints at inflation gradually slowing down.Neither the author, Tim Fries, nor this website, The Tokenist, provide financial advice. Please consult our

In other news, the National Association of Home Builders reported that builders monthly confidence index rose three points in March to 51, rising for the fourth consecutive month as home buyer demand remained strong.

Investing.com,SBN Becomes First Major Central Bank to Cut Rates,2024-03-22,0.666667,"The second big surprise of the week came from the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The Swiss cut the interest rate by 25bp to 1.5% yesterday, in a surprise move, and became the first major central bank to cut rates. The Swiss 10-year yield fell to 65bp and Franc lost against the dollar and the euro.The
USD/CHF
broke above 2022 to 2024 downtrending channel and the
EUR/CHF
spiked above a minor Fibonacci retracement, though it remains well above the pre-pandemic levels both against the greenback and the single currency. The SNB is expected to lower rates two more times this year and the latter should lead to a gradual depreciation of the Swiss franc, help exporters to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and support the stock valuations. UBS observes that a 1% deprecation in the franc leads to around a 0.9% rise in Swiss stocks. The SMI jumped 0.73% yesterday.Now, if the Swiss could kick off the pivot party, it is because inflation in Switzerland has been easier to fight for the SNB thanks to the traditionally strong franc. The Swiss inflation fell to 1.2% in February. But the fact the Swiss jumped into the water raised the expectation that the others would join soon.How soon? If all goes well and inflation remains under control, the Fed and the ECB are also expected to cut in June. In the UK, two Bank of England (BoE) hawks dropped their rate hike vote. As such, no one voted to hike the rates in Britain yesterday, 8 MPC members voted to stay pat and 1 voted to cut. Votes in favor of cut are yet to rise, but the BoE also gives signs of turning its back to policy tightening.Cable
slipped below the 50-DMA and is testing the 100-DMA to the downside this morning, the
Japanese yen
remained offered despite the latest data showing that inflation in Japan rose to a 3-month peak, and the
EUR/USD
sank to the 200-DMA. The selloff was amplified by a surprisingly strong set of economic data released in the US yesterday that got some Fed doves to scratch their heads about the Feds determination to cut rates sometime this year and boosted the
dollar
appetite.Confusion reigns. The Fed  whose underlying economy doesnt necessarily need a rate cut sounds dovish and the ECB  whose underlying economies need a rate cut  remains relatively hawkish. The data tells one story, the policymakers tell another and the prices move unpredictably.But not in the stock markets. There, everything is fine. The European stocks traded at a fresh ATM, the
S&P 500
extended gains to a fresh record as well, this time because the strong data, combined with a dovish Fed, fueled optimism about soft landing.
Nasdaq 100
also renewed the record as Micron Technology (NASDAQ:
MU
) jumped 14% yesterday beating Q2 expectations on strong AI demand. Nike (NYSE:
NKE
) gained timidly after beating expectations on surprise China strength and FedEx (NYSE:
FDX
) also rose on earnings beat and $5 billion buyback program.Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) however tanked 4% as regulators on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean went after the tech giant and its monopolistic behavior. The company looks like its carrying the misery of the world on its shoulders these days. It missed the AI rally, its sued by regulators around the world and China is not playing along. Price-wise, there is now a death cross formation on the daily chart, where the 50-DMA crossed below the 200-DMA, a technical formation that encourages some traders to position short on the stock.Elsewhere, Reddit made a strong debut on the NYSE, the shares opened 38% higher, rose as much as 60%, and settled at +48% at the end of the first day of trading. As I was saying yesterday, the weather conditions for excellent for a first fly, but trading Reddit is suitable for those who love meme stocks.Last but not least,
Bitcoin
managed to hold ground near the $60K this week, gold retreated after hitting a fresh ATH posterior to the Fed decision, while
US crude
failed to extend gains above the $83.70 and is back below the $81pb this morning on weaker US gasoline demand and hope of a ceasefire in Gaza, although the Israeli government said that they will ultimately invade Rafah no matter what the US says. I believe that we will see decent buying into and below the $80pb level both on the back of geopolitical tensions and the dovish central bank expectations. The actual positive trend in US crude could extend to $85pb level."
Investing.com,"USD Dominance, Gold and Crude Reversal, and the Anticipated PCE Impact",2024-03-25,0.666667,"Not much has changed since Friday. The USD has remained strong across the board, despite some initial volatility in the FX markets.Initially, the Fed's dovish stance led to a decline in the USD. However, dovish actions from other central banks soon followed, prompting the dollar to rally while other currencies, notably the GBP and CHF, weakened.The JPY is also under pressure, as speculators are skeptical about any further rate hikes in the near term. Nevertheless, a sudden shift towards risk-off sentiment or FX intervention by Japan could bolster the JPY.In commodities, both gold and
crude oil
are poised for potential declines, suggesting that commodity currencies may remain weak. The MXN, however, might not experience any significant drop but could instead move sideways. Stock markets are following their own trajectory, maintaining an uptrend, though the SP500 may encounter resistance as it approaches higher-degree fifth waves.In the US, the upcoming PCE release on Friday is noteworthy. However, strong data may be overlooked by the market, given that Powell and the Fed seem unconcerned by the recent modest uptick in inflation, possibly anticipating three rate cuts this year. It's also worth noting that market activity might slow towards the end of the week due to holidays in the EU.Turning to the DXY, its strength continues, though some intraday corrections may occur soon. Support lies in the 103.90-104.00 area."
Investing.com,Bubble Jitters? Here's How to Invest Defensively and Still Make a Buck,2024-03-25,0.555556,"The
S&P 500
has surged by +9.7% in the initial 56 business days of 2024. This marks the 15th best start to a year since 1928.Here's a breakdown of those years and the corresponding gains in the first 56 days:What's intriguing is that out of those 14 years is that, in 11 of them, the S&P 500 kept on extending gains after the great start.It's only in 1930, 1931, and 1987 that a different scenario played out. In all other years, it rose extensively, with increases ranging from the least at +2.4% (2012) and +4.3% (1986) to the most substantial at +15.4% (2019) and +14.8% (1936).All of this leads us to the question of whether the market is in a bubble, a concern on many investors' minds.Specifically, the fear revolves around the Magnificent 7 (Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
), Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
), Meta (NASDAQ:
META
), Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
), Alphabet (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
), Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
), and Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
).Before addressing this, let's delve into what constitutes a speculative bubble and examine some famous examples. Then we'll tackle the question head-on.A speculative bubble emerges when market prices experience significant and rapid increases, surpassing the intrinsic value of that market. This doesn't imply that rising prices lack justification, but rather signifies an exceptionally swift ascent.When the robust demand abruptly dissipates, it typically triggers the bursting of the bubble, causing prices to plummet steeply (with the same intensity as their ascent), often resulting in the loss of all accumulated value.Bubbles are fueled by the misguided notion of perpetual price escalation, an irrational belief that prompts investors to make increasingly aggressive purchases they wouldn't consider in different circumstances.- The tulip bubble of the 17th century saw a frenzy for exotic tulips in Holland, driving prices to such extremes that people even sold their houses to purchase tulip bulbs.- The South Sea Bubble in the early 18th century involved the South Sea Company monopolizing trade with the Spanish colonies in Latin America. As rumors circulated about the advantages of its expeditions, the company's share value skyrocketed from 128 pounds to 1,000 pounds within just seven months.- Prices often fell by more than 90% and rarely recovered or could take decades to recover. It took Japan's
Nikkei
40 years to return to new highs, while many tech bubble stocks will never recover their losses.- During the tech bubble, companies simply added ""dot.com"" to their names and saw their stock prices skyrocket without any rational justification for such surges, let alone for buying at such exorbitant prices.Conversely, when we look at the Magnificent 7 today, we observe that these companies are generating substantial profits. Consequently, the high demand for their shares is understandable given their strong corporate performance.Another aspect reflecting the current reality is the Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E). During the technology bubble, numerous companies boasted P/E ratios of 100 or more.In contrast, as of today, the 12-month ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 26. Moreover, the 5-year average is 23, and the 10-year average is 21. This indicates that while the S&P 500 is slightly pricier than usual, it is far from being in a bubble.Well, we have just seen that the market is not immersed in a speculative bubble, but that does not mean that there are not many investors afraid to buy so high.That's okay, there's a remedy for everything. You can trade defensively. Here's a classic way to do it:You can consider investing in companies that have consistently raised their dividends over the past five years. This indicates strong performance and favorable fundamentals. Here are some examples:- Bullish sentiment, indicating expectations for stock prices to rise over the next six months, currently stands at 43.2%, exceeding its historical average of 37.5%.- Conversely, bearish sentiment, suggesting expectations for stock prices to decline over the next six months, is at 27.2%, which is lower than its historical average of 31%.We are very close to entering April, the best month of the year for U.S. energy stocks.Over the past 33 years, April has consistently showcased this sector's outperformance, averaging nearly +2% above the S&P 500.Following closely behind, September and February trail with gains of approximately +1% and +0.75%, respectively.The worst months are November, July and August.And how can one invest in this sector? One option is through the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, an ETF that mirrors the energy sector of the S&P 500 index. With over $26 billion in assets under management, it provides a convenient vehicle for gaining exposure to the energy sector.------When and how to enter or exit the stock market, try InvestingPro,

Investing.com,Stocks in for Wild Trading Week as Economic Data Tests Fed's Rate Cut Resolution,2024-03-25,0.333333,"It will be a strange week, given the calendars lunar eclipse on Monday and the markets closure on Friday. Add to that a PCE report on Friday, the day the market is closed, and a Jay Powell interview on the same day.I cant see why Jay Powell would opt to interview on the same day as the PCE report and when the market is closed. It seems odd. I also cant see why the market should be closed on the same day as a significant economic report. I get it is a holiday, but it is not a federal holiday, so data from the government will be released regardless of the market calendar.The PCE report is expected to show a gain of 0.4% in February, up from 0.3% m/m in January, and a rise of 2.5% y/y from 2.4% last month. Core PCE is expected to drop to 0.3% from 0.4% m/m and is in line with the previous month at 2.8% y/y.It is pretty tough to say that the slowing in inflation has continued on the core PCE with the second month in a row above 0.2%.If the estimates come in as expected, it would push the 3-month rate of change up to 3.5% from 2.6% and the 6-month rate of change up to 2.9% from 2.5%. This is probably why Atlanta Fed Governor Bostic was out on Friday and now only sees one rate cut in 2024, down from his previous expectations of 2.This is pretty much what the Fed has done the entire cycle since they first started raising rates in March 2022, which was to overpromise and under-deliver. The Fed, in its dot plots as rates were rising, also seemed to be low, and those dots just continuously rose throughout 2022 and 2023 until they finally hit the end of the cycle.At this point, it seems like the Fed is promising more rate cuts than what is likely to be given and that, over time, they will continue to walk those rate cuts back. My guess is that by we get to the May meeting, most officials will be hinting at just two rate cuts, and by the June SEP, it firmly shows two cuts, not this mixed bag that the Fed gave this past month.The other trouble is that since the CPI report, the inflation swaps market has been pricing in hotter CPI prints for April and May. Beyond that, it is too far off into the future to get an accurate feel for where inflation will be since the numbers all build upon themselves.It also seems clear that the Fed wants to slow the pace of QT because it knows that banks reserves arent as high as they appear.Now that the Bank Term Funding Program is over, loans on the books will start to roll off, and there is still about $150 billion on loan. That number started coming down this past week. Most of the $150 billion still on the books arrived in the first few weeks, so one would think a good portion of that liquidity will leave over the next few weeks.This means that reserves are currently $150 billion overstated, pushing them closer to $3.35 trillion than the $3.49 trillion values stated on Thursday.So, if one believes that excess liquidity drives this market higher, one must be mindful that draining liquidity could push this market lower. It is also worth noting that reserves could fall in the weeks to come, as tax season is now underway, and taxes are likely to send the Treasury General Account higher. A rising TGA drives reserves lower.The
S&P 500
moved above the upper Bollinger band on Thursday and returned under it on Friday.Additionally, the index hit the upper end of the channel late last week. The rising channel is strong, but given the overbought reading on the Bollinger band and the sell signal from moving back within that band, we could move to the lower end of the channel at 5,180, which is already around the 20-day moving average, which has been serving as support since the beginning of January.The ascending broadening wedge is still in place in the
NASDAQ
, so we need to continue monitoring. There have been an apparent three touches to the upside, and now there should be another move lower still coming here to take it back to the NDX to the lower trend line.One final note is that investment grade spreads started to rise in the past few days, and high yield spreads followed on Friday. If the spreads widen, it will be because financial conditions are beginning to tighten again. Stocks wont do well if spreads start to widen again, so we can add this to our list of things that must be monitored closely.Original Post"

Investing.com,Trade Wars Redux? Chinas Manufacturing Glut and Its Global Implications,2024-03-25,0.333333,"Chinas economy continues to struggle 15 months after reopening from their COVID lockdowns (December 2022).Now, back then, many media pundits expected a booming Chinese recovery as pent-up savers splurged. Inflation was set to re-surge amid all this Chinese demand. And Chinese stocks looked primed to rise.Oh, how wrong they were.But that shouldnt come as a surprise.Why?Because, as I highlighted before on Chinas anemic economy in August 2023  you can read here  China is dealing with
many
structural issues. Ones that cannot be fixed easily.Long story short, it appears China is dealing with its version of the 2008 Financial Crisis as property prices sink, banks and corporations tumble, and deflation spreads.But the real story here is
how
China is trying to fend off this crisis. . .Because it will likely have global ripple effects.So, lets take a closer look at some of this potential contagion.Heres a bit of context on how we got here: Beijing in 2018-19 began cracking down on the rampant property sector (which is estimated to have made up roughly 30% of the total GDP). A big reason was the excessive amount of debt being used to overbuild.Im sure youve heard of ghost cities in China  aka the eerie towns that are full of unoccupied buildings decaying away.All this excessive construction created growth. For instance, just imagine all the labor, concrete,
copper
, etc that went into building these ghost cities.The catch? Well, it was fueled with debt and led to overcapacity  meaning too much supply relative to demand. Hence prices have been declining as all this excess cant be absorbed by buyers. And even worse is that prices are declining against debt (imagine taking out debt to buy an asset, only for the asset price to decline  what an ugly combination).To highlight this point, He Keng  a former deputy head of the statistics bureau  recently
said
at a forum that Chinas 1.4 billion population
probably cant fill
all the vacant homes.So, its safe to assume theres too much property supply. Thus, Chinas short-term focus on boosting growth is now showing its dark side.But what has Beijing decided to do about this?Well, as the property sector reels, they have pushed for investment in the
manufacturing sector
to offset it.For instance  according to the Atlantic Council  Chinese banks are facilitating
massive
new borrowing for Chinas manufacturers as property loans collapse.In fact, in Q3 2023 Chinese banks extended nearly $700 billion
in new loans
 often lent at below-market interest rates  to the sector compared to the previous year.Keep in mind this is a
massive
increase in an economy that
already
overproduces manufactured goods.To put this into perspective  according to the Carnegie Endowment For International Peace  global manufacturing contributes 16% of GDP, fluctuating between 13% and 17% in recent years. But China stands out significantly, with manufacturing constituting a whopping
28%
of its GDP.Thus, this further surge in excess manufacturing to try and stave off declining growth is the
real
problem.I believe there are
two
fundamental issues with China pouring gas on an already over-produced manufacturing sector.1.
Chinese consumers have an
excessively
high savings rate to GDP (meaning they save a tremendous amount). Im talking roughly 50%  compared to the U.S.s 17%. This implies anemic Chinese consumption (you cant do two things with the same currency: either save or spend). Thus, higher savings necessarily means less spending. I detailed this dynamic more in-depth before while dissecting the overhyped BRICS economies (read here).Now, if Chinese consumer spending was
increasing
, then manufacturers may find it more worthwhile to invest in expansion.
But, alas, its not. This is just creating more of a glut
.2.
Chinese companies are already struggling with overcapacity which has pushed prices negative (aka deflation). We have already seen price wars break out in China as producers try and undercut each other to sell inventory. Although this is good for consumers, its not a great recipe for corporations with lots of debt to see their margins shrink (annual profits in China declined 2.3% in 2023 as demand and margins remained anemic).A recent piece by the South China Morning Post (SCMP) covered a story about the 2024 China Corporate Payment Survey recently conducted by Coface which found that
increased competition was deemed the biggest cause of financial difficulties among customers, due in part to excessive capacity in some industries.So even
more
forced capacity in the face of a glut will only make problems worse.These two issues are
why
 I believe  Chinas economy wont get any relief from increased manufacturing investment.Sure, it may stave off an economic slowdown. But it will only cause longer-term problems.
Simply put, Chinese policymakers are kicking the can down the road.Now, you may be wondering:Alright, China seems stuck in a rut. But what does that mean for the global economy?Well. Lets break it down.If the Chinese consumer remains anemic (which it is). And manufacturers keep increasing supply (which they are), theres really only one option to prevent a deflationary collapse.They need to export the glut of supply. Or putting it another way, dump it on foreign markets
.And this is
exactly
what China has been doing.To point out how serious this is, Chinese export prices are
plunging
at rates not seen since 2008 amid all this excess (aka too much supply relative to demand)Theyre literally flooding major economies  such as the eurozone, India, Russia, Latin America, etc  with their over-supplied manufacturing goods. And this has re-sparked trade tensions with China.For example:1. Brazil  Latin Americas largest economy 
recently
opened probes into how Chinese imports have surged amid this flood of cheap goods.2. The Eurozone is looking to place tariffs on Chinese goods  specifically electric vehicles  after they have seen imports affect their own sales (remember Germany is a huge automotive exporter themselves).3. And according to
CNBC
, even without direct sales in the U.S. Chinese automakers are increasingly threatening American counterparts as Chinese vehicle exports soar. For instance, last year, China exported over 5 million vehicles, surpassing Japan as the worlds leading car exporter.Dont be surprised if a trade war ramps up as the global economy tries to fend off a glut of Chinese imports.As always, its a double-edged sword.China ramping up cheaper exports essentially means theyre exporting their deflation abroad (or rather, the cheaper-priced goods are flowing into global markets, which can ease price pressures).Because of this, it may allow central banks  like the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Central Bank of Brazil  to cut interest rates sooner rather than later to prevent further
banking stress
and slowing growth.Surging imports from China could cause domestic issues  such as declining manufacturing competitiveness, rising unemployment, larger deficits, and more debt.For example, if Chinese imports (specifically EVs), in the eurozone keep rising, manufacturers could suffer from diminishing sales and production levels, trickling into bankruptcies and layoffs, and a very upset populace. One has to wonder: will the rest of the world deal with these issues in order for China to export its way out of a slowdown? I dont believe so.Meanwhile, its possible (historically speaking) that China may retaliate against any moves that block their exports  such as tariffs and quotas on Chinese goods. Put simply, if the U.S. or Europe put tariffs (taxes) on Chinese goods, China would likely do the same back.As China struggles to find its footing and turns to the global economy to eke out what it can, this will have big implications for global trade.Remember: declining Chinese imports take
away
from global demand and growth (since China is buying less, which means fewer sales from other countries). And cheaper Chinese exports take
away
from global manufacturing (making domestic producers them less competitive).So, keep an eye on this.Because it will have profound ripple effects  both economically and politically  all over the world."
Investing.com,Gold Continues to Decline; Euro Weakens as the SNB Cuts Interest Rates,2024-03-25,0.666667,"The gold (XAU) price declined by 0.76% on Friday as the
US dollar
continued to strengthen following the release of better-than-expected US macro statistics on Thursday.XAU/USD
has been in a short-term bearish trend ever since it hit an all-time high of 2,220 on 21 March. However, analysts doubt whether the sell-off can continue for very long. 'As long as we have lower real rates, continued central bank buying along with retail demand and political hedging, the depth of the correction in gold is limited. Gold would need to stay above support around $2,150$2,145 to continue its bullish momentum,' said Phillip Streible, the chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures.Fundamentally, the macro environment still supports safe-haven assets. Geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, as well as in the Middle East, haven't settled yet. Meanwhile, major central banks, including the Federal Reserve (Fed), have clearly intended to lower interest rates in 2024. Traders currently price in a 67% probability of a 25-basis-point (bps) rate cut by the Fed in June and expect roughly 80 bps worth of rate reductions in 2024 overall. Lower interest rates usually push the price of gold higher because the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets reduces. Still, some traders notice that the physical demand for gold is weakening.XAU/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the economic calendar is rather uneventful, so gold may continue moving downwards. Only the release of US New Home Sales data at 2:00 p.m. UTC may potentially trigger some volatility in XAU/USD. Better-than-expected figures may potentially increase the bearish pressure on the pair. 'Spot gold may break support at $2,161 per ounce and fall into a $2,147$2,152 range,' said Reuters analyst Wang Tao.The
euro
(EUR) reached a 3-week low following movements in the Swiss franc (
USD/CHF
) and declined by 0.5% due to the strengthening US dollar.A notable shift in the global financial landscape happened last week as the Swiss National Bank (SNB) delivered a rate cut, while several emerging market central banks signaled their readiness to also ease monetary policy, setting the stage for a probable rate reduction by the European Central Bank (ECB) in June.The Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate between 5.25% and 5.5%, aligning with previous forecasts of 3 reductions by the end of the year. However, the regulator clarified that rate cuts would only occur once there is clear evidence that inflation is steadily declining towards the 2% goal. Market expectations for rate reductions this year have moderated to around 84 basis points (bps), a significant drop from about 160 bps at the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, the market has now been pricing more bps of rate reductions than earlier in the week, reflecting growing optimism for potential rate cuts. 'What happened out of the SNB and what happened with the BOE (Bank of England) really opening the door to rate cuts earlier than expected, that's putting the dollar in a better light,' commented Marvin Loh, the senior global macro strategist at State Street (NYSE:
STT
) in Boston, on the recent interest rate decisions.EUR/USD rose slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the economic calendar is fairly light, so volatility may remain low for most of the day. The speech by ECB President Christine Lagarde and the US New Home Sales report at 10:00 a.m. UTC and 2:00 p.m. UTC, respectively, might potentially trigger some volatility in EUR pairsbut usually, their impact is rather mild. Technically, EUR/USD will probably remain under bearish pressure and try to consolidate above the important 1.08000 level. Breaking below the level will indicate the continuation of the bearish trend, with the next target at 1.07800.The Japanese yen (JPY) gained 0.13% on Friday as the recent rally in
USD/JPY
ran out of steam as it faced major resistance in the 152.000 area.The threat of currency intervention from Japanese authorities apparently prevented the JPY from devaluing any further. Indeed, Japanese officials have been making some hawkish comments lately. Masato Kanda, the Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs, has explicitly stated that the JPY's current weakness doesn't reflect fundamental factors. Meanwhile, Shunichi Suzuki, Japan's Finance Minister, said that the government was 'concerned' about the yen's recent fall. 'Japanese officials' verbal intervention is making 152.000 a very strong near-term resistance for USD/JPY,' said Carol Kong, the currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. However, traders continue to expect the JPY to continue weakening, placing USD/JPY longs. Even after the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) landmark interest rate hike last week, the rate difference between Japan and the US is still quite large, supporting buy-and-hold strategies in USD/JPY.USD/JPY was falling slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today's trading session is likely to be relatively quiet, as the formal macroeconomic calendar doesn't feature any major news releases. Only the publication of the US New Home Sales data at 2:00 p.m. UTC may potentially trigger some volatility in USD pairs. Higher-than-expected figures will put more upward pressure on USD/JPY, while lower-than-expected results may bring the pair down towards 150.500."
Investing.com,USD/JPY Bleeding Likely to Continue in the Months Ahead Despite Attempted Rebound,2024-03-25,0.222222,"The Bank of Japan (BoJ) decided to hike the interest rates for the first time after 17 years but the yen has been weakening since then, on fear that this would be a one and done cut.As a result, not only that the yen bulls are nowhere to be found but some traders revised their
USD/JPY
forecasts to 155 for the next 3 months, 150 for the next 6 months and 145 for the next 12 months post the BoJ meeting.Last weeks BoJ meeting and the market reaction to the meeting was a complete disappointment for the yen bulls who thought that the long yen would be the trade of the year. Finally, authorities had to step in this Monday and warn against speculative moves.The yen is stronger this morning, the
Nikkei
is down by nearly 1%. The FX warnings could limit the sellers appetite, but will unlikely bring the yen bulls back.The Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers didnt sound much concerned about the latest blip in inflation at their last week's meeting. The latter sent the
US 2-year yield
lower, and the dollar weakened in the immediate aftermath of the meeting, but the
dollar index
rebounded to close the week at the highest levels since February as the strong US economic data brought the Fed doves to doubt the Feds ability to cut the rates as soon as in June.This week, the US will reveal its latest GDP update for Q4, and the US economy is expected to have grown more than 3% in the final quarter of last year. Thats down from near 5% growth the quarter before, but the number is well above average growth for an economy that is preparing to see its monetary policy loosen.The US equity markets remain in a euphoric mode on the back of soft Fed and robust data. The
S&P 500
had a slow session on Friday, but the index had its best week of the year  and it hasnt been a bad year so far! The index is up by 12% since the year started and nearly 30% since last October  on track for its biggest-ever advance since 1970 ahead of a likely policy easing cycle according to Bloomberg. You bet it is, look at the Feds balance sheet, worth more than $7.5 trillion as of today.And the stats are in favor of a further rise for the
S&P 500
. Over the past 12 rate-cut cycles, the S&P 500 climbed 15% on average  again according to Bloomberg. The positive trend is also true for sovereign and corporate bonds. Two major themes emerge into Q2: rate cuts and AI adoption  both are favorable for stock valuations.In Europe, the stocks had a record-breaking week, as well despite mounting headaches regarding the European luxury stocks and European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Lagardes warning that they cant commit to more rate cuts beyond a June cut  which now sounds like an evidence  the
Stoxx 600
advanced and closed the week above 500. In Switzerland, the SNB cut rates in a surprise move.The
franc
weakened and the SMI also extended gains last week. In contrast to the American and the European stocks, the Swiss equities are well below their post-pandemic peak. But given that around 90% of the SMI revenues are made abroad, a softer franc should clearly help the Swiss stocks healing from an extended period of a strong franc. As per franc, there is room for depreciation. The
dollar
-franc tests the 0.90 psychological resistance to the upside.This is also the major 38.2% Fibonacci retracement on 2022 to end of 2023 drop. The pair will step into a medium-term bullish consolidation zone above this level, but the francs weakness will be limited by the dovish outlook of its major peers. Against the euro, the parity is the most plausible target but again, franc depreciation will likely be slow and gradual.This week, some Eurozone countries will reveal their latest inflation figures this week, but the aggregate number is not due before next Wednesday. The
EUR/USD
has been having a rough time despite a more dovish Fed decision and more hawkish ECB vibes. But I still think that the dollars strength will be limited by the dovish Fed talk and that the EUR/USD will see support near 1.08 and rebound.On the corporate calendar, Reddit and Galderma were the biggest IPOs of last week. Both went relatively well as conditions were ideal for the first day. And this week, Trumps Truth Social will become a publicly traded company by as early as this week according to the latest news.The shareholders of DWAC approved the merger last week. TMGT  Trump Media and Technology Group  will replace DWAC. Note that DWAC has been subject to speculation and high volatility since Trump is back on the political scene. Those who like risk and speculation will be well served."
Investing.com,"Bonds Like Fed FOMC Days, but the Joy Fades Quickly",2024-03-25,0.666667,"Rather than trying to outsmart how the Feds policy meetings will affect the markets in the future, why not just let the markets tell you how they feel?The markets message isnt always obvious, and history isnt a perfect guide, but sometimes its patterns are very insightful.Occasionally, simple patterns in the data might even cause you to discover a perspective that you thought was true, but just aint so (as Mark Twain once warned).As Mish mentioned in a recent Daily and as I covered in last weeks Market Outlook, the long bond (
TLT
) is at a potentially big inflection point.According to that previous article, if the TLT were to move over 3% in either direction over a 4-8 week period, it could have a real impact on stock prices (see last weeks Market Outlook for details).Since the TLT is in such an important position, I did some research to see if FOMC meetings have had a noticeable (and thus predictable) impact on market trends.Here are some interesting insights.Below, youll find a table that shows how the TLT performed on the day prior to the Feds FOMC announcement, then on the day of the announcement, the following day, and finally, the following 5 and 30 days.Note that the green and red shading indicates a move of at least 0.25% up or down, respectively.One pattern that jumps out is that the day of the meeting has been bullish or flat (never down) since the beginning of 2023.However, Fed Chair Powels bullish influence fades the following day as demonstrated by the fact that the days performance has mixed returns.By the 5th day after the meeting, the TLTs have tended to be trading lower than their bullish FOMC day close.If you look at the last row in the table, labeled Total, youll see the sum of each periods performance, which demonstrates that since the start of 2023 TLT has gained 9.6% on Fed announcement days and lost 13.4% in the 5-day period following the announcement.In fact, the 5 and 30-day periods following the meeting have been bearish.Below youll find the same table for the
S&P 500
(SPY).One pattern that jumps out in the SPY data is that the bull market in stocks has not made any progress in the 5-day period following the FOMC meetings.This isnt surprising considering the weakness in TLT during this period and the focus on interest rates around the FOMC meeting.However, that same positive correlation between stocks and interest rates has not been as strong over the longer 30-day period. After the 5-day FOMC weakness, stocks have marched higher regardless of TLTs weakness.Other factors, such as earnings expectations and AI enthusiasm, could easily explain why stocks would buck a bearish trend in rates.In the tables below, youll see the summary data for additional indexes and sectors.One pattern that stands out in the summary table above is that
SMH
has shown some weakness in the 5 days following Fed meetings, but its also been the best performer in every other time frame other than one  Meeting Day, which is clearly won by TLT.What you cant see in the data Ive shared here is that when SMH has been strong, SPY and
QQQ
have overcome bearish sentiment from weakness in TLT.In summary, if SMH and TLT are going in the same direction, dont fight it.Finally, youll notice that Ive also included
XLE
, the energy ETF, in the table above and below. As you can see from the table above, XLE has had a bearish trend around the meeting dates over the last year.However, as youll see in the table below, which shows the performance of all of the same indexes and sector ETFs for last weeks Fed meeting, XLE had a relatively bullish reaction to the last meeting so far.Is the XLE performance an indication that its recent strength is a trend that will continue?Well certainly be keeping an eye on it. Considering all the perspectives on the patterns discussed up to this point, there are some noteworthy patterns from last weeks Fed meeting.Be awareThe beginning of the upcoming week is part of the weak 5-day post-FOMC meeting period. It could present some good trading opportunities.Be cautious if TLT and SMH slide substantially and in tandem.S&P 500 (SPY)

Investing.com,"Warren Buffett Could Have Bought Any of 378 S&P 500 Companies With $74 Billion. Instead, He Piled It All Into 1 Beloved Stock",2024-04-15,0.666667,"Over the course of six decades,
Berkshire Hathaway
(NYSE: BRK.A)
(NYSE: BRK.B)
CEO
Warren Buffett has put on a clinic for Wall Street and everyday investors
. Whereas the broad-based
S&P 500
is nearing a total return, including dividends paid, of 34,000% since the affably named ""Oracle of Omaha"" became CEO in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a jaw-dropping aggregate gain of nearly 5,000,000% for his company's Class A shares (BRK.A)!Even though Buffett is just as fallible as any investor, he and his top investment aides, which until his recent passing included the ""Architect of Berkshire Hathaway,"" Charlie Munger, have demonstrated a knack for finding bargains hiding in plain sight. Decades of sustained outperformance of the S&P 500 is why professional and everyday investors wait on the edge of their proverbial seats to find out what stocks Buffett and his team have been buying and selling.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.Though Buffett has been a recent net-seller of equities, a few stocks have caught his eyeAlthough Buffett has repeatedly opined that he'd ""never bet against America,"" he and his team have been net-sellers of equities for five consecutive quarters. All told, nearly $39 billion more in equities have been sold than purchased between Sept. 1, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2023.In spite of being a net-seller of equities, a couple of stocks have caught the Oracle of Omaha's attention recently. In particular, Berkshire's brightest investment minds have gravitated to two
energy stocks
:
Chevron
(NYSE: CVX)
and
Occidental Petroleum
(NYSE: OXY)
.Since the curtain opened in 2022, Buffett and his team have purchased more than 248 million shares of Occidental Petroleum. Meanwhile, Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that Berkshire's top investors added approximately 15.85 million shares of Chevron in the December-ended quarter. Collectively, these two oil and gas stocks account for $37.2 billion of Berkshire's $368 billion investment portfolio.The reason Buffett and his crew have placed so much conviction and capital behind these two energy stocks is simple: they believe the spot price of crude oil will remain above historic norms, or potentially head even higher. With most major energy companies forced to reduce their capital expenditures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the global supply of crude oil is now somewhat constrained. Typically, when the supply of an in-demand commodity is tight, the price of that commodity heads higher.The lure of Chevron, which is the slightly bigger position by about $3 billion in market value, is that it's an integrated operator. In addition to drilling for oil and natural gas, it operates pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries, which provide either predictable operating cash flow in any economic climate or a hedge against a lower spot price for crude.Story continuesOccidental Petroleum is an integrated oil and gas company, too, but is comparably reliant on its higher-margin drilling operations for most of its revenue. A higher oil price will disproportionately benefit Occidental.Image source: Getty Images.The Oracle of Omaha has put $74 billion to work into one beloved stock in less than six yearsWith Buffett building up a $17 billion stake in Occidental in a little over two years, you'd likely assume that it, Chevron, or perhaps tech stock
Apple
, which comprises nearly 42% of invested assets, are the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stocks to buy -- but you'd be wrong.Although you won't find it listed in Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs, Buffett has spent north of $74 billion purchasing shares of one beloved stock since the midpoint of 2018.To put this into perspective, the benchmark S&P 500 is comprised of 500 companies. As of the closing bell on April 10, 378 of these companies had a market cap of less than $74 billion. Warren Buffett and his top investment aides could have, in theory, purchased any of these 378 time-tested businesses with the cash that's instead been allotted to one special stock in less than six years.What makes Warren Buffett's relentless buying of this beloved stock such an eye-opener is that
it's shares of his own company
that he's purchasing!Prior to July 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's share repurchase program required that shares of the company trade at or below 120% of book value before they could be bought back. At no point in the years leading up to this date did Berkshire's stock dip to or below this threshold, which meant Buffett was unable to pull the trigger on a single cent worth of buybacks.However, things changed in a big way on July 17, 2018. Berkshire Hathaway's board adjusted the covenants governing the company's share repurchase program to allow Buffett and Munger to work their magic. The board laid out two criteria:As long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet; and
Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger believe shares of their company are intrinsically cheap, buybacks can commence without an end date or a ceiling on spending.Buffett has bought back shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock for 22 consecutive quarters since the board amended these criteria.Since Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend, share repurchases are the easiest way for the company to reward its long-term-minded investors. Buying back stock is steadily reducing its outstanding share count, which is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of the company's investors.Additionally, companies with steady or growing net income tend to enjoy a healthy lift to their earnings per share (EPS) because of buybacks. With almost $168 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on Berkshire's balance sheet, as of December 31, you can rest assured that the Oracle of Omaha will continue deploying his company's capital into his favorite stock, Berkshire Hathaway.Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The

Investing.com,This High-Yield Dividend Stock Is a Monster Passive Income Machine,2024-04-15,0.555556,"What does it take to generate passive income? There are two essential ingredients. First, you need up-front money to invest. Second, you need an investment that regularly pays you.The good news is that many investment alternatives pay you for owning them. There's one, in particular, that ranks among the best options, in my view. This high-yield dividend stock is a monster passive income machine.A pipeline powerhouseEnterprise Products Partners
(NYSE: EPD)
is a leading midstream energy company. It was founded in 1998 and is based in Houston.The
limited partnership (LP)
operates more than 50,000 miles of pipeline that transports natural gas liquids (NGLs), natural gas, and crude oil throughout much of the U.S. Enterprise's midstream platform also includes over 300 million barrels of liquids storage, 42 natural gas processing trains, 26 fractionators, 20 deepwater docks, two propane dehydrogenation facilities, and two isobutane dehydrogenation facilities.Enterprise isn't resting on its laurels. The company has roughly $6.5 billion of major projects under construction. Most are NGL-related, including new plants in the Delaware and Midland Basins and the Bahia pipeline.Investors can rest assured Enterprise Products Partners deploys its cash wisely. The LP has delivered an average
return on invested capital (ROIC)
of 12% over the last 10 years. Its ROIC has also been in the double digits every year since 2005 -- a period that included the Great Recession, the oil price collapse of 2014 to 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic.A passive income machine that's priced attractivelyWhat about passive income? Enterprise Products Partners provides plenty of it. The company's distribution yield currently tops 7%. For every $10,000 you invest, you'll receive an annual income of over $700.That income is likely to grow over time. Enterprise Products Partners has increased its distribution for 25 consecutive years with a compound annual growth rate of around 7%.I'm confident the LP will keep that impressive streak going, too. Enterprise's adjusted cash flow from operations (CFFO) continues to grow. It's the
only
midstream company that has consistently increased adjusted CFFO per unit and reduced unit count without any material asset sales.Servicing debt shouldn't disrupt Enterprise Products Partners' distribution payouts either. The company manages its debt well. And it's the only midstream debt issuer with an A- credit rating.As a bonus, Enterprise is priced attractively. Its units trade at 10.9 times forward earnings. That's well below the
S&P 500
energy sector's forward earnings multiple of nearly 13.3.Story continuesOne drawbackSome might think Enterprise Products Partners' focus on fossil fuels could limit its growth. However, I don't see that as a downside. The demand for natural gas and NGLs, in particular, should continue to grow. Enterprise's midstream assets will be needed for a long time to come.There is one drawback to investing in Enterprise, though. LPs must provide each unitholder with a Form K-1. This can make tax preparation more of a hassle.Should you invest $1,000 in Enterprise Products Partners right now?Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:The

Warren Buffett
on April 12 on CNBC.Cramer highlighted that while Buffett continues to earn investor admiration, Musk has faced criticism because of Tesla Inc.'s declining share price.Don't Miss:Are you rich?

Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved?

.""We operate in a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately industry. Buffett consistently delivers,"" Cramer said. ""Musk, however, isn't offering current lucrative opportunities. To many on Wall Street, that's all that matters.""According to Cramer, the support for Musk persists only when Tesla shares are thriving. Initially lauded as a ""genius"" for his innovations in electric vehicles, Musk now confronts skepticism as Tesla's stock has
plummeted over 30% this year
. Observers cite falling prices for Tesla vehicles and increasing competition from Chinese automakers as factors. Concerns are also mounting that Musk may be too distracted by other business ventures, such as his acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter.""With the recent downgrades and slashed price targets, skepticism towards Musk is intensifying,"" Cramer said. ""It appears the appreciation was more for Tesla's market performance than for Musk himself.""But Cramer remains optimistic about Musk's potential.""Even as Tesla struggles and its stock declines, I must remind everyone of Musk's brilliance,"" Cramer said. ""However, some now speculate that he might be losing his innovative edge, or worse, turning into an evil genius'  claims I find unfair, though life often is.""Conversely, Buffett's investment prowess is indisputable, according to Cramer. He praised Berkshire Hathaway for its robustness, driven by a diverse portfolio and a strong insurance sector, with Geico standing out as both effective and economical.Trending:

Their investment philosophies and areas of expertise lie on opposite ends of the spectrum.Story continuesMusk is a visionary entrepreneur who thrives on disruption. He takes calculated risks by venturing into uncharted territories with companies like Tesla and SpaceX. He is about the future, pushing boundaries and chasing long-term, transformative change.Buffett, on the other hand, is a value investor who prioritizes stability and established companies with proven track records. He focuses on the present and the long term through a lens of consistent, reliable returns. He isn't a fan of risks and invests in what he knows and loves. Buffett's success, built on steady and predictable growth, wouldnt have been possible if he followed Musks high-risk, high-reward approach.The key takeaway is that theres no single right investment style. Just like Musk and Buffett excel in their respective lanes, investors come in all shapes and sizes. This is where

Investing.com,"Tesla layoffs hit high performers, some departments slashed, sources say",2024-04-15,0.222222,"Tesla management told
employees Monday that the
recent layoffs
-- which gutted some departments by 20% and even hit high performers -- were largely due to poor financial performance, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.The layoffs were announced to staff just a week before Tesla is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings. The move comes as Tesla has seen its profit margin narrow over the past several quarters, the result of an EV price war that has persisted for at least a year. The company delivered a record
1.81 million vehicles
in 2023. Its margins, however,
took a hit
after Tesla repeatedly slashed prices in a bid to drum up sales and undercut the competition.Tesla informed employees that more than 10%, or about 14,000 workers, will be laid off across the global organization that has operations in the United States, Europe and China. The layoffs, which affected employees across all departments and seniority levels, were made to reduce costs and increase productivity to prepare for its ""next phase of growth,"" according to an internal email from CEO Elon Musk that TechCrunch has viewed.High performers also cutMany of the laid-off employees were high performers, according to two sources who spoke to TechCrunch on condition of anonymity. One source expressed shock at the number of talented employees cut and noted that many of those affected were working on projects that have fallen lower on Tesla's priority list. The source declined to specify which projects.Some departments saw layoffs beyond the 10% outlined in the companywide email, according to sources. One manager told TechCrunch that 20% of their employees were cut.""I lost 20% of my team, some really good players too,"" they said.The shakeup also comes as Musk continues to bend the company's trajectory toward building fully self-driving cars. Tesla recently
dropped plans
to build a lower-cost EV that would retail starting at around $25,000, opting instead to use the underlying platform being developed to power an alleged
robotaxi
that Musk said will debut August 8.Musk previously tried to prioritize the dedicated robotaxi vehicle project, according to his biographer, Walter Isaacson. In 2022, he told employees that he wanted a ""clean robotaxi"" with no steering wheel or pedals. Tesla lead designer Franz von Holzhausen and engineering VP Lars Moravy kept running the low-cost EV project in secret and eventually convinced him to make both -- that is, until last week when it was reported that Musk changed his mind.Story continuesTop execs leaveTwo high-profile executives -- Drew Baglino, Tesla's SVP of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, VP of Public Policy and Business Development -- also
left the company
.Patel told TechCrunch he decided Sunday evening to leave Tesla because of ""[b]ig overall changes"" at the company. Patel, who had been engaging regularly with Tesla customers and fans on X in recent months, declined to be specific. He noted in a message that it would be ""Better for me not to speculate."" ""Tesla is going to be stronger than ever, and change is good,"" he added.Baglino told TechCrunch that after 18 years it was time to leave Tesla. ""I feel good about the impact I've been able to achieve, my leadership team is strong, the energy businesses I'm responsible for are doing well, etc.,"" he wrote in a message to TechCrunch.""Baglino was in charge of powerdrives and new battery projects, and there's a sense that there isn't a whole lot of innovation that's sustainable at this point, which is probably why Baglino is leaving,"" Sandeep Rao, head of research at London-based financial services company Leverage Shares, theorized in an interview with TechCrunch.Baglino's departure comes just a few months after Tesla's previous CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn,
stepped down.
In January,
Musk posted on X
, formerly Twitter, that he would want to have around 25% voting control of Tesla in order to focus more fully on the company, rather than on his other companies, and help the EV-maker become a leader in AI and robotics.View comments"

said
in a post on X that it was a ""difficult decision"" to leave after 18 years at Tesla. Tesla CEO Elon Musk
thanked
both
of them for their time at the company in posts on his social media platform, X.Their departures come as Tesla is laying off thousands of employees in a bid to cut costs and boost productivity, according to an internal email sent to staff by Musk, which
Electrek
and
Bloomberg News
first reported. The electric automaker is cutting ""more than 10%"" of its global headcount, Musk said in the email. Tesla finished 2023
with over 140,000 employees
, meaning the cuts could impact more than 14,000 people.Musk announced the layoffs just two weeks after Tesla reported its first
year-over-year drop in sales
in three years, amid a wider cooling of demand for EVs. The company has warned investors that sales growth could be ""notably lower"" in 2024 than its stated goal of 50% growth each year. It's also somewhat in between product cycles for the first time in years, with the expensive Cybertruck only just recently going into production and the popular Model Y entering its fourth year without any significant updates.""As we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,"" Musk said in the email. Tesla's growth, he said, has led to ""duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas.""""As part of this effort, we have done a thorough review of the organization and made the difficult decision to reduce our headcount by more than 10% globally. There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done. This will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle,"" Musk wrote.Baglino's departure is the second time a top executive has left the company in the past year, as Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn stepped down in
August 2023
. Baglino oversaw engineering for the company's powertrain and battery technologies. He also had become one of the more responsive executives on Musk's social media platform. Patel, who spent years as a special assistant to President Barack Obama and an advisor on climate and energy, was similarly engaging with Tesla customers and fans in recent months.Story continuesTesla shipped
a record
1.8 million EVs in 2023. But the company spent much of the year slashing prices on its most popular models in an effort to counterbalance the impact of high interest rates and increased global competition. The company has also reportedly
dropped
 or at the very least, delayed  plans to build a lower-cost EV that would retail starting at around $25,000, opting instead to use the underlying platform being developed to power an alleged
robotaxi

Investing.com,Tax Day reveals a major split in how Joe Biden and Donald Trump would govern,2024-04-15,0.666667,"WASHINGTON (AP)  Tax Day reveals a major split in how
Joe Biden
and
Donald Trump
would govern: The presidential candidates have conflicting ideas about how much to reveal about their own finances and the best ways to boost the economy through tax policy.Biden, the sitting Democratic president, released his income tax returns on the IRS deadline of Monday. Filing jointly with his wife, Jill, he reported gross income of $619,976 and paid a federal income tax rate of 23.7%.On Tuesday, Biden is scheduled to
deliver a speech
in Scranton, Pennsylvania, about why the wealthy should pay more in taxes to reduce the federal deficit and help fund programs for the poor and middle class.Biden is proud to say that he was largely without money for much of his decades-long career in public service, unlike Trump, who inherited
hundreds of millions of dollars from his father
and used his billionaire status to launch a TV show and later a presidential campaign.For 36 years, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress, Biden told donors in California in February. Not a joke.In 2015, Trump declared as part of his candidacy, I'm really rich.The Republican former president has argued that voters have no need to see his tax data and that past financial disclosures are more than sufficient. He maintains that keeping taxes low for the wealthy will supercharge investment and lead to more jobs, while tax hikes would crush an economy still recovering from inflation that hit a four-decade peak in 2022.Biden wants to give the IRS even more cash by proposing the largest tax hike on the American people in history when they are already being robbed by his record-high inflation crisis, said Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for the Trump campaign.The split goes beyond an ideological difference to a very real challenge for whoever triumphs in the November election. At the end of 2025,
many of the tax cuts
that Trump signed into law in 2017 will expire  setting up an avalanche of choices about how much people across the income spectrum should pay as the national debt is expected to climb to unprecedented levels.Including interest costs, extending all the tax breaks could add another $3.8 trillion to the national debt through 2033, according to an analysis last year by the
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget
.Biden would like to keep the majority of the tax breaks, based on his pledge that no one earning less than $400,000 will have to pay more. But he
released a budget proposal this year
with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations that would raise $4.9 trillion in revenues and trim forecasted deficits by $3.2 trillion over 10 years.Story continuesStill, he's telling voters that he's all for letting the Trump-era tax cuts lapse.Does anyone here think the tax code is fair? Raise your hand, Biden said Tuesday at a speech in Washington's Union Station to a crowd predisposed to dislike Trump's broad tax cuts that helped many in the middle class but disproportionately favored wealthier households.It added more to the national debt than any presidential term in history,"" Biden continued. ""And its due to expire next year. And guess what? I hope to be president because it expires  its going to stay expired.Trump has called for higher tariffs on foreign-made goods, which are taxes that could hit consumers in the form of higher prices. But his campaign is committed to tax cuts while promising that a Trump presidency would reduce a national debt that has risen for decades, including during his Oval Office tenure.""When President Trump is back in the White House, he will advocate for more tax cuts for all Americans and reinvigorate Americas energy industry to bring down inflation, lower the cost of living, and pay down our debt, Leavitt said.Most economists say Trumps tax cuts could not generate enough growth to pay down the national debt. An analysis released Friday by Oxford Economics found that a full-blown Trump policy with tax cuts, higher tariffs and blocking immigration would slow growth and increase inflation.Among Biden's proposals is a billionaire minimum income tax that would apply a minimum rate of 25% on households with a net worth of at least $100 million.The tax would directly target billionaires such as Trump, who refused to release his personal taxes as presidents have traditionally done. But six years of his tax returns were released in 2022 by Democrats on the
House Ways and Means Committee.In 2018, Trump earned more than
$24 million and paid about 4% of that
in federal income taxes. The congressional panel also found that the IRS delayed legally mandated audits of Trump during his presidency, with the panel concluding the audit process was ""
dormant, at best
.""Biden has publicly released more than
two decades of his tax returns
. His tax filings provide key financial details on mortgage interest payments ($20,525) and the $20,477 donated to 17 different charities, including $5,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation and $2,100 to St. Joseph on the Brandywine, the Catholic church he attends in Delaware.Trump has maintained that his tax records are complicated because of his use of various tax credits and past business losses, which in some cases have allowed him to avoid taxes. He also previously declined to release his tax returns under the claim that the IRS was auditing him for pre-presidential filings.His finances recently received a boost from the stock market debut of Trump Media, which controls Trump's preferred social media outlet, Truth Social. Share prices initially surged, adding billions of dollars to Trump's net worth, but investors have since soured on the company and shares by Friday were down more than 50% from their peak.The former president is also on the hook for $542 million due to legal judgments in a civil fraud case and penalties owed to the writer E. Jean Carroll because of statements made by Trump that damaged her reputation after she accused him of sexual assault.In the civil fraud case, New York
Judge Arthur Engoron
looked at the financial records of the Trump Organization and concluded after looking at the inflated assets that the frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience.__Colvin reported from Palm Beach, Florida.View comments"
Investing.com,"We're 66 With $1.4 Million in IRAs, and $4,100 Monthly From Social Security. What's Our Retirement Budget?",2024-04-15,0.666667,"Say that, as a married couple, you have $1.4 million in your IRAs and, at age 66, expect about $4,100 per month in
Social Security
. Based on some typical rules of thumb, you might be able to plan on about $108,000 per year of retirement income, but how much you actually need and will be able to take will depend on your specific circumstances.Here's how to think about it, including a breakdown of the numbers. And if you want someone to double check your own retirement calculations, consider
matching with a financial advisor for free
.How to Make A Retirement BudgetFrequent commenter to this section Kevin Caldwell, Principal with the wealth management firm
Golden Road Advisors,
refers to retirement planning as an approach in ""buckets.""As you prepare for retirement, it's good to think about your budget in terms of specific parts of life. One way to organize this is:Needs
Lifestyle
Aspiration
EstateYour needs bucket is the money that, at a bare minimum, you need to survive. What is the income that must come in the door each month in order to keep the food warm and the bills paid?Your lifestyle bucket is the money that, realistically, you want in order to live the life you enjoy. This is not money for big, new things. Rather, it's the money to keep going out to your favorite restaurants and taking your regular trips.Your aspiration bucket is the money that, ideally, lets you add to or expand your lifestyle. This is the money for a new boat, that round-the-world-trip, or retiring at 60. It's for those big swings.Finally, your estate bucket is the money for anything you intend to leave behind. Whether there are people who will need you, or just something you care about, this is how you plan for it.Thinking about retirement this way can make budgeting more clear.An
experienced fiduciary financial advisor
can help you build a plan that covers all the bases.Judging When You Can RetireIf your
retirement income
won't meet the needs bucket, then you simply can't afford to retire, not yet. You will lose the house. If it meets only the needs bucket, then you can technically afford to retire, but you should wait if at all possible.If your retirement income meets your lifestyle bucket, then you should generally be fine. You can probably retire comfortably, provided youve got proper risk management in place, including
long-term care insurance
. The same is true if your retirement income meets the aspirational bucket, in which case good for you.And the wild card is your
estate bucket
. This depends on your individual circumstances. Some retirees have dependents or obligations, reasons that they must leave a minimum estate. Others simply would like to leave something for their loved ones. This is situational.Story continuesRetirement IncomeThen, you have to match your budget with your income.Your retirement income will come from your combined benefits,
pensions
and assets. For most households, this generally means retirement accounts and Social Security. In our example here, let's say you are a married couple with $1.4 million in your
IRAs
. You're 66 and can currently collect $4,100 in Social Security benefits.Let's start with Social Security. At 66, you would collect
93.3%
of your full benefits. If you wait until age 67, you can increase your annual Social Security income to $52,733 per year. Since this increase will last for the rest of your life, it's likely worth waiting if you can. (If you wait until age 70 to collect Social Security, you can
increase
your lifetime benefits further, to $65,388 per year.)Then there are your IRAs. There are several ways to think about portfolio income. The standard option is the 4% rule. Under this logic, you assume a combination of secure investments and inflation-adjusted withdrawals leading to 4% withdrawals over 25 years. Starting with $1.4 million, that would give you about $56,000 per year.This gives us our number up top. Combined, your full Social Security benefits and a 4% IRA withdrawal rate would come to about $108,733 of inflation-adjusted income per year.Speak with a financial advisor
for free to project your own retirement budget.That said, there are many ways to think about portfolio income. For example, you could use this portfolio to purchase a lifetime annuity. That annuity might
generate
about $112,584 per year ($9,382 per month). This is significantly more at the outset than a 4% plan, giving you a combined income of $161,784, but on the other hand it will not increase with inflation. Or you could invest for more aggressive returns, levying more equities into your portfolio for a growth rate closer to 8% than 4%. This might give you significantly more income over time, but at the cost of significantly more volatility as well.It all depends on your personal situation and capacity for risk.Withdrawal, Taxes and NeedsFinally, there are your withdrawal needs.First, make sure to keep an eye on your
RMDs
. This is the minimum amount you must take from your portfolio every year starting at age 73. For example, take that 4% burn rate. At age 73 you would have about $1.12 million left in your IRAs, triggering a $42,264 RMD.Given that your planned income is likely higher than this the RMD rule will probably not be an issue, but it's important to remember.Then there are taxes. You will pay full income taxes on all earnings withdrawn from an IRA just like with ordinary income. Here, you will also pay income taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits because your AGI will be relatively high.A
financial advisor
can help you determine an effective tax strategy for your retirement accounts.Other ConsiderationsFinally, make sure to prepare for the specific needs that retirement brings. When you retire, several different structures change in your life. On the one hand, you can expect your income needs to drop. Most households spend less in retirement, and not having to dedicate money to retirement savings will free up a significant portion of your budget (between 5% and 10% for most households). On the other hand, you will have new expenses. Among other issues, you will need
gap insurance
(to cover needs Medicare doesn't cover) and long-term care insurance (in case you or your spouse have residential needs in the future). When you run the math on your needs and lifestyle spending, make sure to account for costs like this.Finally, don't forget
inflation
, especially if you rent your home or live in a high-cost urban area. Even at the Federal Reserve's 2% benchmark, prices tend to double roughly every 30 years. Social Security is benchmarked to this, and many income strategies are too, but it's important to keep an eye on.For professional insights for your own retirement plan, you can get matched and
speak with a financial advisor
for free.The Bottom LineWith a $1.4 million IRA and about $4,100 per month in Social Security at age 66, you might expect a retirement income of around $108,000 per year. What your actual retirement budget is, though, that depends entirely on your lifestyle and needs.Retirement Budgeting TipsMaking a retirement budget needs to start with your spending and needs, as much as your income. Many households start with their portfolio and hope they can work backwards from there.
But as you plan for your retirement, make sure to keep an eye on what you need that money to accomplish as well.
A financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

Beyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROIWhile the banks base case is for two rate cuts this year, UBS now sees a growing possibility that inflation fails to decline to the Feds target, spurring a pivot back to hikes and sparking a deep selloff in bonds and stocks. Markets have already scaled back bets on policy easing as recent US data has shown surprising strength in the worlds biggest economy.If the expansion remains resilient and inflation gets stuck at 2.5% or higher, there would be real risk the FOMC resumes raising rates again by early next year, reaching 6.5% Fed Funds by mid-next year, said UBS strategists including Jonathan Pingle and Bhanu Baweja in a note.The call shows how major banks are coming to terms with the possibility that the most aggressive hiking cycle since the 1980s  taking the Feds rate to 5.5%  might not be over just yet. UBS has already tempered an aggressive view for 275 basis points of US cuts this year, to now forecast just 50 basis points.Its so-called no landing scenario of more rate hikes would prompt a sharp flattening of the US Treasury curve as benchmark yields move meaningfully higher, as well as a 10%-15% slide in equities, the strategists projected.The call followed stronger-than-expected US inflation data last week, and came ahead of US retail sales Monday that also topped estimates. Thats made for a string of hot data points, fanning concerns that inflation is becoming entrenched. Traders have drastically pared bets on Fed easing to price 41 basis points by December, down from 150 basis points at the start of the year.Investors are in the early stages of worrying about an economy that may be running too hot, the UBS strategists said. In a high inflation scenario we would expect both government bonds to selloff and credit spreads to widen, making for a big catch down in multiples.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality

S&P 500 Breaks Below 5,100 as Big Tech Sells Off: Markets Wrap
Apple Faces Worst iPhone Slump Since Covid as Rivals RiseThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid the most since August, with every major market seeing losses, after a slew of Chinas economic indicators showed that the nations economic recovery remains patchy. Futures contracts for US and European equities fell in Asian trading after the S&P 500 slid more than 1% in a volatile session overnight following robust retail sales data.A global gauge of emerging market currencies dropped, with South Koreas won and the Indonesia rupiah weakening to multi-year lows. Traders also blamed the yuans fall for the regionwide selloff after China unexpectedly weakened its defense as a resurgent dollar and poor sentiment pushed it toward a policy red line.The carnage is the result of a perfect storm: stretched positioning across global equity indexes, a third successive month of firm US inflation data contributing to unease within a deeply troubled bond market against the rising risk of miscalculation and escalation in the Middle East, said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG Australia.A slew of Chinas economic data points showed that the nations economic rebound remains uneven. While both gross domestic product and fixed assets investment beat forecasts, data on retail sales and industrial output fell short of estimates.China data appears to be strong on the headline, but the details are weak, said Charu Chanana, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo Markets in Singapore. This would suggest that the economy needs more support, and markets will continue to position for a weak yuan.A gauge of the dollar climbed to its highest level since November. The resurgent strength in the currency, driven by haven demand amid rising geopolitical tensions in Middle East, wreaked havoc across Asia.Indonesias rupiah weakened past 16,000 per dollar for the first time since 2020, prompting the nations central bank to intervene. The South Korean won dropped to its lowest since 2022, while the Indian rupee tumbled to a record low against the dollar.The Japanese yen remained under pressure, after surging to a new 34-year low against the dollar overnight.Story continuesWest Texas Intermediate rose in Asia after reclaiming its $85 mark on Monday. Top Israeli military officials reiterated the country has no choice but to answer Irans weekend attack. Gold was steady.Treasuries steadied in Asian trading after the 10-year yields spiked on Monday, while those on two-year notes came close to 5%. Bonds were also under pressure as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. tapped the US high-grade bond market, the first in a likely parade of bond sales from banks after results.US retail sales rose by more than forecast in March and the prior month was revised higher, showcasing resilient consumer demand that keeps fueling a surprisingly strong economy.

Investing.com,Why Medical Properties Trust Stock Popped Today,2024-04-16,0.555556,"Shares of
Medical Properties Trust
(NYSE: MPW)
soared 18.8% on Monday after the healthcare facilities-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) announced a major asset sale.Medical Properties Trust announces a huge Utah dealLate Friday, the company said it had sold its interests in five Utah hospitals to a newly formed joint venture with an investment fund for $886 million. Medical Properties Trust has retained a roughly 25% interest in the joint venture, while the fund purchased a 75% stake. The joint venture also placed new non-recourse secured financing simultaneous with the closing of the sale, giving Medical Properties Trust $190 million of additional cash. Altogether, the deal generates roughly $1.1 billion of total cash proceeds to Medical Properties Trust.What's next for Medical Properties Trust investors?Medical Properties Trust said the proceeds will be primarily used to reduce
outstanding debt
, including payment in full of its $300 million Australian term loan due this year and repayment of borrowings under its revolving credit facility.The news came only a few days after Medical Properties Trust announced the sale of five facilities in California and New Jersey to Prime Healthcare for $350 million. Less than three weeks ago, Medical Properties Trust also rallied after its single largest tenant, beleaguered hospital operator Steward Health Care, announced a
separate deal to divest its nationwide physician network
to a subsidiary of
UnitedHealth
. Steward Health owed Medical Properties Trust a total of $50 million in unpaid rent as of the end of 2023.In the end, investors are rightly celebrating as Medical Properties Trust works to selectively divest assets and clean up its balance sheet. Considering this beaten-down stock's dividend payout currently yields around 12.7% annually, it might well prove to be a solid value for those investors willing to bet it will be able to restore the business to a more steady state in the coming quarters.Should you invest $1,000 in Medical Properties Trust right now?Before you buy stock in Medical Properties Trust, consider this:The

Investing.com,TSMC first-quarter profit expected to rise 5% on strong AI chip demand,2024-04-16,0.555556,"By Ben Blanchard and Faith HungTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the dominant producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is expected to report a 5% rise in first-quarter profit on Thursday thanks to strong demand.The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards AI that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand and pushed TSMC's stock to a record high.TSMC is set to report a net profit of T$217.2 billion ($6.71 billion) for the quarter ended March 31, according to an LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 22 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.That compares to the first-quarter net profit of T$206.9 billion last year.TSMC last week reported a 16.5% rise in first-quarter revenue, beating market expectations and at the high end of the company's own guidance.Eric Yao, a vice president at Taiwan's Eastspring Investments, which manages about T$90 billion of client assets in Taiwanese stocks, said the $6.6 billion in U.S. subsidies for TSMC's new Arizona plants augured well for its prospects of maintaining its lead in advanced process technologies.""TSMC will likely continue to lead in that front, and Intel and Samsung will not have much chance to catch up,"" he said, referring to two rivals who want to challenge the company's dominance.Intel this month disclosed deepening operating losses for its foundry business, a blow to the chipmaker as it tries to regain a technology lead it lost in recent years to TSMC, which also announced last week it would build a third fab in Arizona.Fubon Securities analysts said they expected TSMC to revise up its outlook for AI demand for future years.""TSMC previously indicated that AI could account for high-teens of its revenue by 2026, but based on our calculation, we think the target could be reached earlier in 2025.""The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock having surged 36% so far this year to a historic high, compared with a 14% gain for the broader market.TSMC is due to hold an earnings call at 0600 GMT on Thursday.($1 = 32.3890 Taiwan dollars)(Reporting by Ben Blanchard and Faith Hung; Editing by Jamie Freed)View comments"

Investing.com,2 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy and Hold for Great Long-Term Potential,2024-04-15,0.555556,"The massive investment underway to transition traditional computing in data centers to accelerated computing for artificial intelligence (AI) is a major catalyst for leading chip stocks.Applications using generative AI could add trillions of value to the global economy, according to
JPMorgan
. Here are two leading semiconductor companies supplying the hardware to make this happen.NvidiaNvidia
(NASDAQ: NVDA)
is estimated to control 80% of the market for chips used for
AI
, and that lucrative position provides the company with tremendous profits to fund years of innovation. The company's
graphics processing units (GPUs)
are used by OpenAI's ChatGPT and all the leading cloud services. Nvidia posted triple-digit revenue growth last year, with demand pointing to another strong year of growth in 2024.The stock has climbed 78% just since the beginning of the year, but that's largely because investors are still catching up to the incredible growth the company is experiencing. Surging demand for its GPU systems pushed Nvidia's adjusted profit up 286% last year to $32 billion.In March, Nvidia unveiled the new Blackwell GPU-based platform that features 208 billion transistors, providing the computing power for generative AI requirements.
Amazon
,
Tesla
,
Meta Platforms
, and
Microsoft
are among some of the companies expected to adopt Blackwell.Nvidia is dominating the market for AI chips because of its previous expertise in designing graphics processors used for playing video games. CEO Jensen Huang's forward thinking led the company to adapt its GPU technology to several markets, including self-driving cars, robotics, and supercomputers for AI. Its ability to adapt makes Nvidia a solid buy-and-hold investment.I wouldn't underestimate the company's ability to keep growing for many years. Wall Street analysts have been raising their growth forecast and currently expect Nvidia's earnings to grow at 35% per year on an annualized basis. With the stock's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at 36, it still offers attractive long-term return potential.Marvell TechnologyOne name that many investors are growing more optimistic about in the semiconductor industry is
Marvell Technology
(NASDAQ: MRVL)
. The company's products, including ethernet adapters and storage solutions, help data centers move, store, and process data. The stock has climbed 76% over the last year, as its data center business is experiencing strong demand.Marvell's revenue grew just 1% last quarter, but its data center revenue grew 54% year over year to a record $754 million, with AI revenue over $200 million. The current Wall Street estimate has the company's total revenue increasing by 42% over the next two years to reach $8.4 billion.Story continuesThe company expects to see softness in certain markets in the near term, such as consumer applications, wireless products, and enterprise networking. But it's guiding for sequential growth in data centers next quarter. Management sees a lot of opportunities related to AI and is continuing to invest for more growth.These results show that Marvell will be a major beneficiary of the massive ramp of investment in data center infrastructure. Data centers are rapidly upgrading components to handle the large data streams that AI training requires. Specifically, Marvell's AI-related revenue has grown from 3% in fiscal 2023 to 10% in fiscal 2024.The forward P/E has stretched to a premium of 49, but analysts expect Marvell's long-term earnings growth to increase at an annualized rate of 26%.

Apple Faces Worst iPhone Slump Since Covid as Rivals RiseTheres almost $9 trillion right now sitting in money market funds, and the same amount sitting in cash alternatives at banks, Robert Kapito, president of the worlds largest asset manager, said at the Asia Pacific Financial and Innovation Symposium in Melbourne on Tuesday.That money pile is set to be a very big force in the equity market, which has shrunk as investors shifted to private assets, he said. This is going to be something you want to be paying very close attention to, you dont want to miss this, said Kapito.Read More: BlackRocks Kapito Salivating Over $7 Trillion Cash PileHow quickly investors decide to move away from cash may well depend on the Federal Reserves next move on interest rates. The combination of strong US growth and sticky inflation is raising the odds the Fed hikes rather than cuts interest rates, bringing borrowing costs to as high as 6.5% next year, according to UBS Group AG strategists.Kapito has pointed to the cash pile sitting in money markets before. In January, Kapito said he is eyeing the trillions of dollars of dormant investors cash that could soon be reallocated to bonds if interest rates fall. Much of the money-market cash could be shifted toward model portfolios and exchange-traded funds, he said at the time.BlackRock is seeking to position itself as a one-stop shop for a full range of investing options, including alternative assets that are in greater demand by institutional clients such as pensions, endowments and sovereign wealth funds. While alternatives currently account for roughly 3% of BlackRocks assets under management, they bring in about 10% of fees.--With assistance from Ainsley Thomson.(adds further comments from BlackRocks Kapito.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality

Investing.com,Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 2 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead,2024-04-15,0.555556,"The artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush is in full swing, and
Nvidia
has been one of the biggest winners thus far. Its chips power the most advanced AI systems, including ChatGPT from OpenAI, and its share price rocketed 230% over the past year. But
Goldman Sachs
thinks software and services companies could be the biggest beneficiaries in the long run..Several Wall Street billionaires seem to be thinking along the same lines. The hedge fund managers listed below sold down their positions in Nvidia in the fourth quarter and reinvested capital in AI stocks that fit more neatly into the software and cloud services categories.Israel Englander at Millennium Management sold 1.7 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 45%.
Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management sold 1.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 66%.Meanwhile, Englander and Cohen purchased shares of
Amazon
(NASDAQ: AMZN)
and
Palantir Technologies
(NYSE: PLTR)
during the fourth quarter, supercharged AI stocks that soared 84% and 170%, respectively, over the past year.1. AmazonAmazon reported fourth-quarter results that crushed Wall Street's expectations. Sales increased 14% to $170 billion, the third straight quarter in which growth has accelerated sequentially. That was primarily due to momentum in advertising and retail, but cloud computing sales also accelerated from the previous quarter. Meanwhile,
GAAP
net income improved to $1.00 per diluted share, up from $0.03 per diluted share in the prior year.Amazon is set to maintain that momentum given its strong presence in three markets. It runs the most popular e-commerce marketplace in the world as measured by monthly visitors, and the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe as measured by sales. Amazon is also the largest retail advertiser and the third largest ad tech company in the world. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services.That puts Amazon on a glidepath to double-digit sales growth through 2030. I say that because the online retail, digital advertising, and cloud computing markets are projected to grow at annual rates of 8%, 16%, and 14%, respectively, during that period. Indeed, with those tailwinds at its back, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow sales at 11% annually over the next five year.However, Amazon could surprise Wall Street depending on how successfully it monetizes artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in its cloud computing business. The company has designed custom chips for AI training and inference, called Trainium and Inferentia. Those chips
cannot outperform
Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), but they are more cost effective in certain situations and could bring more business to AWS.Story continuesAdditionally, Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service that lets businesses customize large language models and build generative AI applications. Likewise, Amazon Q is a conversational business assistant that leans on generative AI to search and summarize information from various internal and external data sources. The chatbot can also answer questions and automate tasks like writing blogs and social media posts. Collectively, those products could drive faster-than-expected sales growth for Amazon.Shares currently trade at 3.4 times sales, a tolerable valuation if Wall Street's consensus is correct and a more reasonable valuation if the company manages to grow sales faster than 11% annually. Personally, I think Amazon is a worthwhile long-term investment as its current price.2. Palantir TechnologiesPalantir reported reasonably good financial results in the fourth quarter, beating expectations on the top line and meeting expectations on the bottom line. Its customer count increased 35% to 497 and the average existing customer spent 8% more. In turn, revenue rose 20% to $608 million, reflecting 32% growth in commercial sales and 11% growth in government sales. Non-GAAP net income doubled to reach $0.08 per diluted share.CEO Alex Karp commented on Palantir's AI ambitions in his annual sharholder letter. ""Every part of our organization is focused on the rollout of our Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which has gone from prototype to product in months. And our momentum with AIP is now significantly contributing to new revenue and new customers,"" he wrote. AIP brings support for large language models to Palantir's commercial platform, Foundry.To elaborate, Palantir builds software that helps businesses integrate and analyze data, develop and manage machine learning (ML) models, and build applications that improve decision-making.
Forrester Research
has recognized Palantir's Foundry as a leading AI/ML platform. AIP enhances Foundry, such that clients can develop and utilize generative AI to improve business outcomes. For instance, one of the largest U.S. healthcare organizations is using AIP to generate shift schedules that consider employee preferences, decision costs, and demand predictions.In other news, the U.S. Army recently selected Palantir to build its Titan ground station system, which uses AI/ML to rapidly process data received from sensors placed in terrestrial, aerial, high altitude, and extraterrestrial locations. The 24-month contract is valued at $178 million, so it will not significantly move the needle for Palantir, but it does highlight its versatility and the contract could lead to further deals with the U.S. government.Going forward, the data analytics market is forecasted to grow at 27% annually through 2030. While I doubt Palantir will match that pace given its past performance and small customer base, the tailwind still has positive implications for the company. Wall Street expects Palantir to grow sales at 21% annually over the next five years.In that context, its current valuation of 23.5 time sales looks expensive, especially when the three-year average is 17.8 times sales. Also noteworthy, Palantir currently carries a consensus sell rating among Wall Street analysts, and the stock bears a median price target of $20.50 per share, which implies 10% downside from its current price of $22.80 per share. I would steer clear of Palantir until the stock trade at a more reasonable valuation.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The

Buying rental properties is a popular one, but those properties could lose money if you hire a property manager that doesn't maintain them or keep them occupied with paying tenants.Investors looking to build a truly passive income stream are probably better off buying dividend-paying stocks. If you pick businesses that can continue growing their bottom line, you could receive a passive income stream that keeps rising without any extra effort from you.Image source: Getty Images.Pfizer

,
Ares Capital
(NASDAQ: ARCC)
, and
AT&T
(NYSE: T)
look poised to produce steady earnings growth for at least another decade. Plus, they offer an average dividend yield of 7.6% at recent prices. That's more than five times the average yield you'd receive from dividend payers in the benchmark
S&P 500
index.The average yield from these stocks is high enough that an investment of $13,200 spread between them is more than enough to set yourself up with $1,000 in annual dividend income.PfizerShares of Pfizer have been beaten down about 37% over the past 12 months, largely because COVID-19 product sales evaporated faster than investors had expected. Luckily for income-seeking investors, the $44.2 billion reduction in annual COVID-19 product sales that Pfizer reported last year didn't derail the company's 15-year streak of consecutive annual dividend payout raises.At recent prices, Pfizer offers a 6.5% yield. Thanks to wise investments the pharma giant made with its COVID-19 products, there's a good chance that it can continue raising its payout for another 15 years.Over a dozen Pfizer drugs grew sales by 10% or better last year once adjusted for a stronger dollar. If we ignore tanking sales of its COVID-19 products, the company reported total revenue that rose by 7% last year.Continued growth at a high single-digit annual percentage seems likely for Pfizer. The company received a record nine new drug approvals from the Food and Drug Administration last year.Ares CapitalAres Capital is America's largest publicly traded business development company (
BDC
). Ares and its BDC peers are popular among income-seeking investors because they don't have to pay income taxes as long as they return at least 90% of their earnings to investors as dividend payments.At recent prices, Ares Capital offers a 9.5% dividend yield. Its quarterly payout hasn't risen in a straight line, but it is up by 20% over the past three years.As a BDC, Ares Capital is essentially a lender to middle-market businesses that generally have between $10 million and $1 billion in annual revenue. Banks tend to ignore midsize businesses, so they're willing to pay eye-popping interest rates. At the end of 2023, Ares Capital's debt portfolio was earning a 12.5% average yield.Story continuesAround 60% of Ares Capital's portfolio is made of first and second-lien secured loans, which are first in line to be repaid in the event of bankruptcy.Many years of slow but steady payout bumps seem likely for Ares Capital shareholders thanks to an underwriting department that deserves a gold star. At the end of 2023, 69% of Ares Capital's portfolio was collecting interest at floating rates. Despite interest rates that rose sharply in recent years, just 1.3% of the BDC's portfolio was on nonaccrual status at the end of 2023.AT&TAT&T might not show up when most investors screen for great dividend stocks, because the company slashed its payout by 47% in 2022 after selling off risky and unpredictable media assets. At recent prices, it offers a 6.8% yield and there's a good chance it can start raising that payout again soon.Wireline telephone and internet revenue is drying up, but the company's investments in 5G infrastructure could work out well for long-term shareholders. The company grew wireless service revenue by 4.4% last year. Fiber sales soared 27% last year, and overall broadband internet sales could soar further in 2024. Late last year, AT&T launched a new fixed wireless service for customers in areas where Fiber still isn't available.AT&T generated $16.8 billion in
free cash flow
last year, and profit is rising. In 2024, management expects free cash flow to land in a range between $17 billion and $18 billion. That's more than it needs to pay down debt and start raising its payout again.Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:The

Israel Versus Iran  What All-Out War Could Look Like
Apple Faces Worst iPhone Slump Since Covid as Rivals RiseHype around the launch and better-than-expected initial orders for the SU7 have helped a rally in Xiaomi shares gain momentum. Investors have meanwhile ramped up bets on further declines in EV makers NIO Inc. and Xpeng Inc., with short interest on their US listings at about 86% and 36% of total shares outstanding, respectively.In stark contrast to Apple Inc.s failed car dreams, Xiaomi and Huawei Technologies Co. are demonstrating early success in transferring their smartphone prowess into the crowded EV market, where rampant price competition is taking a toll.The entry of Xiaomi and Huawei is a significant disruption, particularly by the leverage of their expertise in consumer technology and supply chain management, said Bing Yuan, fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. Their focus on smart functionalities set a high bar for what consumers expect in terms of vehicle capabilities.In addition to the new competition, the broader EV industry is suffering from shifting consumer preferences, Chinas slowing economy and concerns of higher interest rates in the US and elsewhere.Tesla Inc.s shares are down 35% so far this year, while Nio and Xpeng have halved in US trading.The cash-burning Chinese startups are seen as more vulnerable to the negative impact of industrywide price cuts than more established traditional automakers like BYD Co. They may also need to make major adjustments to compete with the new entrants from the smartphone industry.The disruption is beyond the product itself  rather, it stems from the effective combination of successful marketing, branding, and, to a greater extent, established ecosystem, Morgan Stanley analysts including Tim Hsiao wrote in a note. Competing with tech veterans appears to be an uphill but inevitable battle for automakers.The marketing capabilities and strong appeal among young consumers that Xiaomi have developed are well utilized in its EV business. The SU7 has been a hot topic on Chinese social media with a push from Lei Jun, the companys billionaire co-founder, who boasts 23 million followers on Weibo.Story continuesXiaomi has said it is targeting the premium segment especially. With a base price of 215,900 yuan (around $30,000), the SU7 series comes in nine different color and features a connected entertainment system as well as autonomous driving.Enthusiasm for the launch has helped push Xiaomis Hong Kong-listed shares up 36% from a February low, but it still has much to prove in terms of customer satisfaction and delivery ability. And the companys overall results will most likely continue to hinge on the slowly recovering demand for smartphones, which account for around 60% of its sales.As the macro outlook is still unclear, costs are key to success not only for individual EV models but ultimately to the financial health of the automakers themselves. BYD has managed to stay profitable, supported by its broader array of products and strong exports, while the smaller China-focused EV pure plays Nio and Xpeng post losses.Promotional spending to boost sales will magnify the bottom-line pressure from price cuts, with Nio and Xpeng both launching new campaigns recently. They both make vehicles seen in direct competition with Xiaomis offerings.Ultimately everyone could be a loser within the 200k-300k yuan BEV segment, unless the strong SU7 features attract incremental substitution effects from internal combustion engines, partially mitigating the negative impacts from model oversupply, Citigroup Inc. analysts including Jeff Chung wrote in a note.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality

Investing.com,Why Rivian Stock Dropped Again Today,2024-04-15,0.222222,"Rivian Automotive
(NASDAQ: RIVN)
shares have been in a free fall recently. That continued today as seemingly bad news from electric vehicle (EV) makers continued to be released. Even though there hasn't any real negative news out of Rivian itself, shares have plunged by more than 50% in the last three months.Today's drop seems to be more of the same. Bigger-picture EV news that implies a continued drop in demand seems to be hitting Rivian particularly hard. Rivian stock was down 5.1% to start this trading week as of 11:45 a.m. ET Monday.EV makers cutting backOne factor that hit Rivian shares recently was the decision by
Ford Motor Company
to cut pricing on its F-150 Lightning models by as much as $5,500. That vehicle is one of the only direct competitors to Rivian's R1T full-size electric pickup truck.The downward momentum continued today when EV leader
Tesla
told employees it would be
laying off at least 10% of its global workforce
. Tesla delivered about 9% fewer vehicles in the first quarter compared to last year's first quarter, which disappointed investors. But Rivian's first-quarter deliveries matched its expectations and the company says it is on track to produce 57,000 EVs this year.That's about the same production volume as last year as the company takes some delays to implement upgrades in preparation for its next generation R2 models. The lower-priced R2 SUV is expected to be available beginning in 2026.That's still a relatively long way away, and EV market demand is currently in question. Ford's price cuts were meant to
draw down unsold inventory
. And Tesla's downsizing also doesn't imply that demand is accelerating. But Rivian has so far established its unique brand and has a path to expand its market with lower-priced vehicles. Investors who foresee a successful journey to that end might do well buying Rivian shares at these all-time lows.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The

brokerage account
, for the most part, is not an account you want loaded with cash. If you want access to cash for emergency expenses and near-term financial goals, then a
savings account
is your best bet. Your brokerage account, by contrast, should be loaded with stocks and other investments designed to generate nice returns.But keeping a small amount of cash in your brokerage account isn't a bad idea. In fact, it can be a good practice to uphold. Here's why.Read more:
unlock best-in-class perks with one of these brokerage accountsYou don't want to miss out on buying opportunitiesAs a general rule, it's not a good idea to try to time the stock market. If you hold off on investing because you're waiting for stock values to fall across the board, you might end up missing out on chances to grow your wealth over time.But if there's a specific stock you've been following for a long time, then in that situation, it
is
OK to try to buy it at a lower price. To be clear, this doesn't mean you should chase the lowest price, period. But it's OK to chase a
lower
price than what you've been seeing.Let's say you've been looking to add shares of a specific company to your portfolio and they've been steadily trading at $200 apiece. Let's also say that the same company releases earnings and the results aren't so favorable. The company's share price might then fall to $180 temporarily due to an overreaction from investors.Things like this can happen all the time. And in a few days, that stock's value might rise back up to $200 per share. But meanwhile, you have an opportunity. Instead of paying $200 a share, you can get in at $180. To do that, though, you need to have cash available in your brokerage account ready to go. And
that's
why it pays to keep a little cash in your brokerage account. That way, you can capitalize on opportunities like the one just described.Although some brokerage accounts will allow you to trade on margin (where you're effectively borrowing from your brokerage account to cover your buys), doing so can be risky. And it's not always an option.But it can also take a few days for a transfer of money to clear your brokerage account after leaving your bank account. And when you're trying to take advantage of a dip in a company's stock price, you may not have a few days. So it's important to leave yourself with some cash to trade with.You may want to pump more cash into your brokerage account ahead of a recessionRecessions and stock market declines don't always go hand in hand, but they can. So if recession warnings start sounding in full force, it could be worth transferring some extra money into your brokerage account. That way, if stock values do fall, you'll have an opportunity to load up on quality investments at a discount.Story continuesBefore you do this, though, make sure your emergency fund is fully set. Only move funds over for investing purposes that you wouldn't need to cover essential bills in the event of a layoff. But if you have extra money at your disposal, keeping some cash in a brokerage account ahead of a recession also isn't a bad idea.Alert: our top-rated cash back card now has 0% intro APR until 2025This credit card is not just good  its so exceptional that our experts use it personally.

Investing.com,"Bitcoin Drops Below $65,000",2024-04-15,0.555556,"In recent days,
Bitcoin
(CRYPTO: BTC)
has experienced a whirlwind of volatility, with its price plummeting as low as $61,000. In the wake of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, things feel much different from when it hit a new all-time high of $73,000 in mid-March. For many investors, such sharp fluctuations may trigger anxiety and concern.However, as a seasoned Bitcoin enthusiast and investor, I remain steadfast in my conviction that this dip is nothing more than a temporary blip on the radar of Bitcoin's long-term trajectory of price appreciation.Image source: Getty Images.What drove its price downTo understand the recent turbulence in Bitcoin's price, we must first acknowledge the context of its remarkable ascent. Maintaining momentum from an impressive 2023, Bitcoin defied expectations in early 2024 by surging to an all-time high before the next halving, a feat the cryptocurrency had
never accomplished
.The euphoria surrounding its astronomical rise inevitably led to a period of profit-taking. Based on data from blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, Bitcoin is currently experiencing its most extensive selloff by long-term holders since early 2021.This profit-taking was exacerbated as fears of conflict between Israel and Iran transpired over the weekend. Bitcoin has since recouped some of its recent losses, with its price hovering around the $63,000 mark.A necessary grain of saltDespite the short-term fluctuations and pronounced volatility, it's essential to zoom out and consider the broader picture of Bitcoin's journey. One of the most significant developments in the cryptocurrency market this year has been the approval of
spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
. In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, providing deep-pocketed institutional investors with direct access to the cryptocurrency market. This landmark decision was long awaited and represents a significant step forward in Bitcoin's mainstream adoption.Adding to the fervor, interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs seems to be growing beyond the U.S. Hong Kong is also poised to introduce its own spot Bitcoin ETFs, signaling another step toward the global recognition of Bitcoin's legitimacy as an investment asset and possibly adding further pressure to its finite supply as East Asian markets pile into the cryptocurrency.Beyond the encouraging developments, the fundamentals of Bitcoin remain remarkably robust. Bitcoin's hash rate, a measure of its network's processing power and security, is near an all-time high, indicating the resilience and continued strength of the network.Story continuesFurthermore, Bitcoin's upcoming halving, scheduled for April 20, is poised to send its supply grow rate to roughly 0.85%, reinforcing its scarcity and long-term value proposition. With the recent arrival of institutions and the spot Bitcoin ETFs, this halving is shaping up to be unlike any before.Beyond its technical metrics, Bitcoin's core characteristics continue to distinguish it as a unique and viable asset in the current economic landscape. As a decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin serves as a reliable store of value, immune to the whims of central banks and government intervention. Last, and perhaps most importantly, with a finite supply capped at 21 million coins (about 19.7 million already circulate), Bitcoin's scarcity ensures its status as a deflationary asset over time, especially at a time when inflation continues to rear its ugly head.What it means todayWhile Bitcoin's recent price drop may spark concern among some investors, it would be more prudent to view the selloff as a compelling opportunity to accumulate at a discounted price relative to its long-term potential. As Warren Buffett famously said, ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.""With Bitcoin's fundamentals stronger than ever and its adoption accelerating globally, I remain bullish on its prospects and steadfast in my conviction as a long-term Bitcoin investor. Over the long haul, this period of volatility will probably prove to be but a minor speed bump in Bitcoin's historic journey.Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:The

Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon on Monday sold $32.8 million in the banks stock, bringing the total proceeds from shaving off a portion of his ownership stake to nearly $183 million this year.In February,
he offloaded more than 800,000
shares worth $150 million, marking the first time he sold JPMorgan stock since becoming CEO 19 years ago.Dimon is known to be a strong believer in eating your own cooking and holding onto equity. But the company said last year that he and his family planned to sell 1 million shares of JPMorgan for financial diversification and tax planning purposes.As of last year, Dimon held 8.6 million shares of JPMorgan stock and stock appreciation rights relating to 1.5 million shares. His compensation in 2023 was valued at $36 million, with $29.5 million in the form of stock awards. The boards compensation committee introduced a policy in 2022 that caps Dimons annual cash bonus at 25% of his annual comp. In 2023, the board gave Dimon a bonus of $5 million, which the company says is well under the $10 million median of total cash amounts for CEOs at the banks peers. Until this year, he had never sold stock in JPMorgan. The share price was $182.89 today, up 6.3% year to date.Another member of Dimons inner circle at JPMorgan, global chief information officer Lori Beer, also sold stock recently. In March, Beer sold 3,920 shares worth $765,811 after previously selling on the same day as Dimons first sale. On Feb. 22, Beer sold off 3,920 shares at a slightly lower stock price for $716,340.February saw

S&P 500
climbing, extending its gains in this bull market, you may wonder if it's too late to get in on the action. But I've got some good news for you: When you invest over the long term -- at least five years -- you'll find great investing opportunities during any market environment. In investing, time is on your side, offering you the chance to benefit as a company evolves and delivers on various promises from product launches to earnings growth.Today is a particularly interesting moment to invest in technology as we head for what could be the next revolution in the field: artificial intelligence (AI). Some AI stocks have soared, while others haven't yet gained momentum -- and in both of these areas, you'll find players likely to gain over the long term. That's why if you have $50,000, or even a smaller amount, that you don't need for everyday expenses and want to grow over time, it's a fantastic idea to invest it in a basket of tech stocks that may benefit from the AI boom.So now, let's talk about the best stocks to buy right now. The following four all could become AI winners, but they also have solid businesses beyond this technology. So, when you buy them, you aren't betting the farm on just one particular area, and this offers you a fantastic combination of growth and safety.Image source: Getty Images.1. Super Micro ComputerSuper Micro Computer
(NASDAQ: SMCI)
stock has soared a mind-boggling 2,200% over the past three years, so you may hesitate to get in on this story now. But this actually could be just the beginning of Supermicro's growth story because we're in the early days of AI development -- and Supermicro can benefit from growth of all of the top AI chipmakers.This is because the maker of servers, full rack scale solutions, and other equipment needed for AI includes chips of these players in its systems -- and it follows their product development closely so that it can immediately make these innovations available to its customers.Supermicro said recently that it's seeing ongoing record demand for its rack scale solutions for AI including some of these best-selling chips. And new releases, such as
the upcoming launch
of
Nvidia
's Blackwell architecture could further boost orders. All of this should translate into ongoing earnings growth well into the future and push the shares higher.2. IntelIntel
(NASDAQ: INTC)
is the leading maker of central processing units, the key component of a computer. But Intel hasn't yet benefited from the excitement surrounding AI. The chipmaker fell behind in
the AI space
, and that's been one of the elements weighing on its shares.Story continuesBut things may be about to change for two reasons. Intel recently launched a new portfolio of AI products, including its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator that may even challenge Nvidia's H100 chip.Of course, Nvidia's preparing to launch its most powerful chip ever based on the Blackwell architecture as mentioned above -- so I don't expect Intel to beat this market leader. But it doesn't have to. Gaudi 3's performance and affordability could help it carve out enough market share to boost Intel's earnings and eventually share price over time.And Intel's second bit of good news? The company is opening up its manufacturing to others, and this could result in a whole new growth driver as the AI boom continues.3. AmazonAmazon
(NASDAQ: AMZN)
has a long track record of earnings growth thanks to its leadership in the high-growth markets of e-commerce and cloud computing. And this is likely to continue as the company has invested to help it maintain leadership here. In e-commerce, Amazon has revamped its fulfillment network to make deliveries faster, a move that pleases customers and makes Amazon more cost efficient.As for cloud computing, AI is set to play a big role in growth moving forward. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is heavily investing to serve the AI customer's every need -- from the basics like chips and software to a fully managed service that allows customers to tailor popular large language models for their own use.This should help AWS keep its long-held position as the world's No. 1 cloud computing services provider -- and lift revenue over time. That's particularly good news because AWS historically has been the driver of overall profit at Amazon. And all of this means Amazon stock has plenty of room to run, even after recent gains.4. AlphabetAlphabet
(NASDAQ: GOOG)
(NASDAQ: GOOGL)
is known for helping most of us on a daily basis. It's the owner of Google Search, the search engine with more than 90% share of the global search market. Alphabet's top business even has managed to enter our language, with people often answering a question with: ""let's Google it.""And now, Alphabet's investment in AI is likely to further strengthen the company's leadership in the search market. Alphabet recently launched Gemini, it's most advanced AI model yet, and is incorporating AI in all products and services -- including search. The move is making search better and making the advertising process easier, and this should keep advertising revenue climbing. This is key because Alphabet makes most of its revenue through Google advertising.Alphabet also offers investors a solid track record of earnings growth, and even during the recent difficult economic times, advertising revenue held up pretty well. That makes this company one of the safest AI bets on my list, and a great place to park a portion of your $50,000 today.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The

Investing.com,Stocks Stabilize Despite War Threats; BoJ Vigilant on USD/JPY Movements,2024-04-15,0.555556,"On Saturday, there was some risk-off sentiment spreading due to new tensions between Iran and Israel in the Middle East, but it appears that markets were able to stabilize a bit and investros calmed down by the time market opened on Sunday night. It's very interesting to see this price stabilization in stocks despite some fear spreading over the weekend.Looking at the US dollar, we are seeing some intraday minor pullbacks, but I'm afraid that the US dollar has room for more strength, especially when looking at different structures in the FX pairs. We are also seeing a very strong rise in the Dollar-Yen, but it looks like the Bank of Japan is concerned about the potential weakness of the Japanese Yen, so they will most likely hold some new meetings, maybe even with other countries, and will possibly even act on the FX flor to send the Japanese Yen higher or at least to stop this current drop. Just be aware that there can be some volatile reversals in Yen pairs.
Keep in mind that looking at the
USDJPY
right now, we are seeing prices in a fifth wave up. So, we know that after five waves up, the market can slow down for a minimum three-wave correction. Therefore, some kind of correction here is clearly very possible, if not probable."
Investing.com,Banking Crisis Redux,2024-04-11,0.333333,"Kicking the Can, Ignoring the Inevitable
Its been just over a year since the March banking crisis, when we saw three of the four largest bank failures in US history. So it should really be no surprise that to avoid talks of systemic failure and bank runs the Fed swooped in with an emergency Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), to prop up the banking sector. But now, a year later, the safety net has expired, having distributed $168B during its life.
Data from Bloomberg Terminal
Until the very end this has been somewhat of a mixed bag, leaving us with more questions than answers.
What are the likely consequences of ending the BTFP? How the Fed could unabashedly create a Wall Street money-printing arbitrage machine? How much of the borrowing was pure arbitrage versus genuine liquidity concerns? Should we be worried that banks showed more interest in lending to the Fed by borrowing from it, rather than lending to each other and going to the broader economy?
But then again, this ambiguity is typical of the Federal Reserve - buying time rather than provide definitive answers.
Back to the Beginning
Let's rewind to March 12th, 2023. Silicon Valley Bank had just collapsed. In response, the Fed, in consultation with other banks, devised the BTFP. According to their press release, the original purpose was:
""Additional funding will be made available through the creation of a new bank term funding program offering loans of up to one year in length to banks... pledging ...qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par.
At least the Fed learnt a crucial lesson from the 2008 financial crisis  banks need liquidity. The figure circulating was around one third of banks were at risk of failure without the bailouts. Having probably known this Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell effectively decided to bail out every bank in America with sweetheart loans written based on fictitious asset values.
One undeniable consequence of having all banks borrow from the Fed is that it has made it impossible for us to see which banks were in trouble. When banks turned to the Fed, it was a sign that not all was well. But now everyone is going to the Fed. Meaning we can no longer differentiate between the banks that were going for free money and those that had genuine liquidity troubles.
Sweetheart Loans
The first thing to remember is that the Fed can both lend out money, and accept deposits. If you wanted to borrow from the Fed using the BTFP youd be charge the 'Overnight Index Swap' rate (OIS) plus 10 basis points, which is a market based rate.
Alternatively, if you wanted to deposit money with the Fed you could do this at the Fed Fund Rate, which is determined by the Fed itself, not by the market.
This meant that banks could use this setup to borrow from the Fed's BTFP at the 1-year OIS rate plus 10 basis points, and then promptly deposit the funds back to the Fed at the Fed Fund rate. Its exactly like getting a loan from your local bank at one interest rate and then depositing it straight into the same banks savings account at another rate.
Date taken from Bloomberg Terminal
In November, the loan rate dropped below the deposit rate. By mid-January the loan rate had decreased to around 4.9%, while the deposit rate remained at 5.4%. This resulted in a half percentage point spread for the banks, with no accompanying risk. A nice little ready-made arbitrage opportunity.
For such an important player in the US economy and with all the smart people they have working for them its funny that they wouldn't anticipate that at some point the this set up could result in a deep arbitrage opportunity. An alternative perspective is that this scenario was deliberately orchestrated to create such an opportunity for banks to make, essentially, free money.
Extra! Extra! Fed printing free money for big bank bailouts! Read all about it!
Once that was discovered, they couldn't extend the life of this program. Consequently, in January the Fed announced that by March this facility would be no more.
One consequence of the arbitrage opportunity that the banks capitalised on (reflected in a significant increase in the BTFP balance) is the implication that there were no better investment opportunities in the real economy other than parking funds with the Fed. The Feds spread apparently represented 'peak' investing for all the ambitious, money-hungry, extreme-capitalist US banks.
Fictitious Assets
The global economic system rests heavily on debt, which banks tend to want to back with some sort of asset. So, it's completely unsurprising that the issue of collateral keeps coming up again and again.
What should really be jumping out at us from the Feds statement is their choice (and it is a conscious choice) to value collateral ""at par"". They could have said ""at market value."" But they didnt. In this context, the collateral being valued ""at par"" essentially means being valued at what the bank would get if is held everything until maturity, rather than what they would get if they went to market today. Which they would have to do in times of crisis.
If the banks didnt have access to the BTFP they would have had to go to the Feds Discount Window which values collateral based on market value.
The question, then, arises: why did the BTFP value collateral ""at par""? The answer no one would want to hear is that the assets the banks are holding are worth jack if they had to be sold today; and to evade this truth, a convenient workaround was devised to value the assets ""at par"" back when they had some semblance of value.
So, why has the value of bank collateral gone down the drain? Consider now, that banks are holding bonds issued during a period of very low interest rates say 2009  2022. When interest rose in 2022, newly issued bonds offer higher yields to investors, making existing bonds with lower interest rates less attractive in comparison, causing their market value to decrease. The par value however remains constant.
If loans were secured by bonds valued at ""market value,"" these assets may only be a fraction of the collateral needed to secure a loan to cover their liquidity requirements. But par value  that's still nice and high.
This potential shortfall comes right off of the 2020 decision to reduce reserve requirement ratios to zero.
Lets also try to remember what was the significant shift since the onset of the pandemic: the shift to remote work. Our once bustling offices now sit empty. Consequently, the commercial real estate (CRE) market has been hit hard, facing substantial challenges, with a staggering $929 billion in debt maturing this year, necessitating refinancing or sale. Good luck with that  as interest rates are at their highest since 2009, and CRE sales are down 63%! Adding to the complexity, the debt figure represents a 40% increase from the previous year. Couple that with CRE delinquency rates skyrocketing to 6.5%, up from 5.1% the quarter before  a 27% increase.
When the smoke clears, we might witness the fall of dozens, even hundreds, of banks, particularly midsized regional ones that tend to have a higher proportion of their assets tied up in CRE. So far, we've only witnessed the sickest banks falling out of the pack.
Bloomberg News Analysis of Y-9 Filings for Bank Holding Companies (as of Sep 30)
For the last 15 years the Fed policy of flooding easy money to developers has contributed to this mess. So now that interest rates are being pushed up, to quote-unquote fight inflation, the value of the debt issued during those years is underwater. But it's not just CRE; its auto loans, student loans, credit cards, and the myriad derivative bets made against that debt or its credit quality. CRE is merely scratching the surface of this iceberg  the real danger lurks in the total accumulated debt from the past 15 years that remains hidden from view.
Data from Bloomberg Terminal
Spending to Save
Central banks are now left trying to balance inflation and a mountain of falling asset prices that are trying to prop up an economy of more debt than ever before. To balance these contradictory requirements the Fed has set a 2% inflation target to try and gradually erode the real value of debt over time, without triggering major buying-behaviour changes from the public.
When people lose faith in the currency, they tend to throw their money at anything they think might store value - real estate, gold, cryptocurrencies etc. - anything to avoid a loss in value. The equity markets hitting record highs despite the disconnect from underlying fundamentals is a symptom of this dynamic. People are wanting to park their money in assets they believe will hold value better than the US dollar. However, this speculative frenzy is not a sustainable solution to the deeper structural issues facing the US economy.
The Shiller ratio is used to see if a market is overvalued (the higher the value the more its overvalued). The current figure of 35x is a top 4% figure  meaning see are seeing aggressive overvaluation.
Data taken from http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe
The increasing M2 velocity - the rate at which money changes hands in the economy - serves as a valuable indicator of public confidence in the dollar. There is, however, a fine line between a general uptick in economic activity and public fears about descending into a hyper-inflationary price spiral. So view this metric as a supplement to other analysis.
Data from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V
Repayments Rolling-In
We've explored various angles, but let's circle back to the BTFP. After a year of extending loans, banks will now face the task of repaying them.
During its first week, the BTFP saw an initial lending volume of $12B billion. Subsequently, in response to bank failures, there was a notable surge, with lending skyrocketing up by $42B. The following two weeks we saw additional injections of $10B and $15B, respectively. Culminating in a final loaned volume of $79B within the program's first month.
How banks choose to navigate this repayment process will shed light on their liquidity health. Banks opting to use the Discount Window, could signal difficulties in accessing private funding sources, all but confirming their collateral inadequacy. Alternatively, they could choose to draw from their cash reserves or tap into the private marketplace via repos.
As the answers to these questions start to come in over the next year, we will start to understand the current state of the US banking system."

There is an underlying economic momentum that seems to have put the hard landing scenario out of sight. Q4 2023 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was just revised upward to +3.4% after a 3Q reading of +4.9%. Both numbers represented positive surprises and were well ahead of the pace set in the first half of 2023.While the economy is undoubtedly slowing after 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, the central bank projects growth to be stronger in 2024 than they thought just a few months ago (+2.1% for the year). Steady, but not dazzling.Strong corporate earnings are the second positive factor. Earnings for S&P 500 companies grew 9.8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to data from LSEG and Capital Group. Although results in Q1 2024 may be a bit lower, consensus estimates for 2024 as a whole suggest a sustained earnings rebound.Third, the excitement and momentum surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) will continue to drive big tech and should spread to smaller tech companies as they figure out how to monetize it. And while the tech sector is looking expensive on a historical basis, it is nowhere near the Dot-Com Bubble levels seen in 2000.Right now, tech stocks are priced at about 27 times forward 12-month earnings. During the Dot-Com Bubble, it was closer to 60x. If AI continues to drive growth (and we believe it will), then the sector will be okay.Original Article"
Investing.com,US Dollar Stalls at Resistance Despite Upbeat Jobs Data,2024-04-08,0.555556,"Hey everyone.On financial markets, we observed a rebound in the stock market last Friday, an interesting development given the strong U.S. jobs data. Despite an initial surge, the U.S. dollar experienced a decline later in the day, amidst speculation that the Federal Reserve might hold off on rate cuts if the economy maintains its momentum. A pivotal element to watch this week is the U.S. inflation report due on Wednesday. Additionally, rate decisions from the RBNZ and the BoC are scheduled for the same day, with the ECB announcement to follow on Thursday. This sets the stage for a potentially volatile week, particularly for XXX/USD pairs, given the mixed signals across the board. In commodities, metals are trending upward, and the
USD/JPY
pair has risen, likely influenced by higher U.S. yields. Conversely,
crude oil
prices have dropped as Middle East tensions eased, following Israel's withdrawal of additional forces from southern Gaza.
Examining the latest
dollar index
chart reveals a notable short-term reversal pattern pointing downwards, especially if stock markets continue to find support. Its interesting to note that stocks have risen post-strong jobs data, a situation typically viewed as bearish in the current financial cycle since it suggests a reduced likelihood of Fed rate cuts. So is this market reaction, short-term bullish?
The Dollar Index (DXY) displays a clear five-wave decline, hinting that a weakening dollar could further bolster stock support."

It all starts with a reduction in consumer spending, which leads to a decrease in production and an increase in unemployment, further unwinding the spiral of negative economic aspects. These episodes accentuate the complex dynamics of the German economy's response to recessionary pressures, highlighting the interdependence of different economic sectors and the challenges associated with reversing recessionary trends.The recession in Germany has historically highlighted the country's economic resilience and, at the same time, vulnerability. The country navigated through significant downturns, such as the 1991 recession, a challenging period from July 2001 to March 2002, and a shorter recession in 2004, during which the
DAX index
surprisingly grew by 2.5%. The 2008 global financial crisis led to a dramatic 37% drop in the DAX from Q2 2008 to Q1 2009. Furthermore, a recession emerged from Q4 2012 to Q1 2013 amidst the European sovereign debt crisis, and the economy was hit again in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic.Germany is pivotal in the European Union (EU) and a crucial trade partner to Asian countries, underlining its significance in the global economic landscape. As Europe's largest economy, Germany's economic activities have far-reaching implications not only within the EU but also across the world.The backbone of Germany's economy is anchored in its manufacturing industry and services sector, contributing 23.5% and 69.3%, respectively, while construction and agriculture add another 6.0% and 1.2% to the economic mix.In terms of trade, intra-EU exchanges constitute 53% of Germany's exports, with France and the Netherlands being prominent partners. Conversely, China is a major non-EU trading partner. Notably, imports from EU member states represent 52% of Germany's total imports, highlighting the deep economic integration within the EU.Since 2016, China has emerged as Germany's principal trading partner, underscoring the shifting dynamics of global trade. The trade volume with China accounts for nearly 20% of Germany's total trade activities. Furthermore, German industries heavily rely on the Chinese market, with an average of 20% of their sales originating from China. This reliance highlights Germany's challenges in diversifying its trade relationships. The dependency on China as a vital market for Germany's leading industries suggests a complex path toward reducing economic reliance.Germany's economic prowess significantly influences the European Union's trade dynamics, given its central role in the European Single Market and as a significant beneficiary of the euro. Almost 52 percent of Germany's imports come from the EU, showcasing its interconnectedness with the bloc's economy. A recession in Germany could disrupt these trade flows, particularly affecting Central and Eastern European countries like the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are heavily reliant on the German market. The potential decrease in German demand for imports could adversely affect these nations' economic growth, underscoring the intricate web of dependencies within the EU.A downturn in Germany's economy could send shockwaves through European financial markets. Stock market volatility and a weakened euro might result from decreased investor confidence in the eurozone's stability. The ECB and national governments might be compelled to enact monetary and fiscal interventions to mitigate these effects, aiming to stabilize the euro and maintain investor confidence.
In sum, Germany's economic health is vital for the stability and prosperity of the European Union. The potential impacts of a German recession highlight the need for robust economic policies and a coordinated response from the ECB and individual EU countries to safeguard the bloc's economy against such downturns.The recession in Germany could theoretically impact Asian economies, especially those with strong trade and investment ties to the European powerhouse.
As Germany is one of the significant import destinations for Asian products, a downturn could result in decreased exports from these countries, negatively affecting their trade balances and economic growth. Additionally, Germany's critical role in global manufacturing processes means a slowdown could disrupt supply chains. Consequently, a German recession might lead to a cautious reassessment of growth forecasts for key Asian economies, as negative factors contribute to a more uncertain economic outlook.
Trade turnover between the most prominent players in the Asian region and Germany includes:Despite the extensive economic ties between Germany and major Asian economies like China, Japan, and South Korea, it's crucial to note that these nations do not rely heavily on Germany. For instance, Germany constitutes only 4.1% of China's imports, 3.22% for Korea, and 2.70% for Japan, indicating a balanced relationship. This interdependence means that Germany also depends on Asia for imports and as a vital export market, underscoring the mutual benefits of their economic interactions.Recessions in Germany often lead to a decline in German blue chips value, as reflected in the DAX index, and a fall or slowdown in German GDP growth. This decline is often reflected in the dynamics of the European index due to the close interconnection of EU economies.The situation in Germany is an essential reminder of the interconnectedness of global economies. If Germany's economy falters, it is only a matter of time before the consequences are felt throughout the EU and beyond. However, current challenges also present opportunities for optimism and growth. The German government's recognition of economic vulnerabilities is the first step towards recovery, signaling a proactive approach to addressing these challenges.The latest release showed that German inflation, measured by the change in consumer price index (CPI), fell to 2.5% in early February from 2.9% in January. This gives us reasonable hope that the ECB will soon decide to loosen its monetary policy, and an interest rate cut is just around the corner. This step will help revive the economy of both Germany in particular and the eurozone as a whole.However, one should not unquestioningly hope for an optimistic scenario since the main geopolitical and macroeconomic influences still need to be on the agenda and continue to threaten the stability of Germany and the world economy.Regarding the DAX, we can project with caution that in 2024, due to recessionary pressures, it might not surpass the 18,000 resistance level, potentially correcting to 16,000 before rebounding to 19,000.For the Nikkei index, a similar trajectory is expected. After an unsuccessful attempt to exceed the 40,000 resistance, it is anticipated to adjust downwards to 33,000 before climbing to 44,000.In conclusion, the economic interdependence between Germany, the EU, and big Asian economies highlights the global impact of the German recession. The synchronized movements of the DAX index with European and Asian stock indices during recessions show the degree of worldwide interconnectedness and Germany's vital role in the global economy.While historical patterns provide insight into the market's potential response to future recessions, the unique context of each economic downturn underscores the difficulty of predicting economic outcomes. This interconnected situation highlights the need for vigilant monitoring and adaptive strategies to navigate the complex web of global financial relationships.***

Investing.com,Changing the Feds 2% Inflation Target  FAIT Non-Accompli?,2024-03-26,0.333333,"As the steadier measures of inflation (core, median, or sticky depending on your preferences) have started to overshoot expectations slightly  the y/y measures continue to decline, but slower than expected as the m/m numbers have surprised on the high side  the markets have continued to price Fed policy becoming increasingly easier over the course of 2024 and into 2025. While Fed officials continue to push back gently on this assumption, it seems that most of the FOMC is comfortable with the idea that there will be at least
some
decrease in overnight rates later in the year and the only question is how much.While inflation has not been settling gently back to target, there have developed two big holes in the narrative that the Fed was depending on. First, there is no reason to think that rent of shelter is going to cross over into deflation, either in 2024 or any time in the future. The belief that the CPI for rents would follow the high-frequency data into deflation was never well-founded, despite some fancy-looking papers that claimed you could get three pounds of fertilizer out of a one-pound bag if you just squeezed it the right way (I discussed 
Disentangling Rent Index Differences: Data, Methods, and Scope
, and why it wasnt going to tell us anything we didnt already know, in my podcast last July entitled 
Inflation Folk Remedies
), and while rents are declining they are not
plunging
, and home prices themselves have turned back higher and are growing faster than inflation again.Second, core-services-ex-rents (so-called supercore) inflation needed to see wages decelerate a lot in order for that piece to get back towards target. They havent, and it hasnt.This isnt to say that these things may not eventually happen, but so far the expectation that we would get back to target sustainably by the middle of 2024 looks quite unlikely. Why, then, are people talking about when the first eases will happen? The only way that it makes sense to do so is if the goal to get inflation back to 2% sustainably is no longer driving policy.This has led to some observers pointing out that the Fed doesnt
actually
have a 2% target any longer. In 2019, the Fed moved to Flexible Average Inflation Targeting, or FAIT. Under this rubric, the Fed doesnt need to regard 2% (or about 2.25% on CPI) as a target that they need to hit at a moment in time but only as an average over some period of time. This obviates the need for overly-aggressive monetary policy in either direction, such as the instantaneous adjustment linked directly to the inflation-miss that is required by the Taylor Rule.Unfortunately, under that rule the Fed has little if any chance of meeting its mandate. It would have a better chance of hitting 2% inumlets say a transitory way, as rental inflation swings lower and we pass close to the target briefly before inflation goes back up to its new equilibrium level.
Back in August 2021
I noted that the Fed was already above the FAIT projected from the announcement of that policy, and in fact had used up all of the post-GFC slack. Obviously, it has gotten worse since then. Below, I update the two charts from that article. The first chart shows the CPI from August 2019, along with the average-inflation-targeting line and the forwards suggested by the CPI swap market (showing where inflation futures would be trading, if they were trading).The second chart shows the CPI back to January 2013. Weve made up all of the inflation from the post-GFC deflation scare, and then some.Note that the inflation swap market is not indicating any expectation that prices will return back to the trendline. The market is acting as if the Fed is still operating under the old rules, where the goal was to get inflation to be stable at 2%
from here
, wherever here is. This means one of four things will have to happen, or it implies a fifth thing.If none of these things happens, and the Fed then implies that the inflation market is going to permanently imply something different from what the Fed claims to be its
modus operandi
. In that case, it would be very hard to argue that the central bank had not lost credibility, wouldnt it?Original Post"

Investing.com,"Bull Run Over? Inflation, Geopolitical Fears Push S&P 500 Below Critical Support",2024-04-16,0.222222,"Stocks finished the day sharply lower for a second day in a row, with the
S&P 500
dropping by 1.2% and the
NASDAQ
dropping by 1.65%. The S&P 500 opened higher, but the selling started around 10 AM and continued all day long. It led to a 2% decline in the index from high to close.Yesterdays decline followed a big beat and upward revisions in
retail sales
for March and February, respectively. This sent rates across the yield curve ripping higher, with the
10-year
climbing by eight bps to close at 4.61% on the day, while the
dollar index
jumped to 106.20.Whats incredible now is that 1-year breakevens are trading at 4.35%, 2-years are trading at 2.95%, and 5-years are trading at 2.57%. If the market were worried and playing the flight to safety game, inflation expectations wouldnt have risen; they would have fallen, and Treasury yields would have moved down, not up.Additionally, things like the
USD/JPY
typically trade lower during periods of uncertainty and fear, and that was not the case yesterday. The yen rose to over 154 and reached its highest level in June 1990. The yens next significant level of resistance may not come until 158.Yesterday, we also saw the spread between the US 10 and the
Germany 10-Year
widen to 2.17%, its widest since October 2019, and it could still go higher from here. The technicals suggest the spread could widen to around 2.5%. Again, this is not something you would expect to see in a flight to safety.So, with a flight to safety likely ruled out for the stock markets decline yesterday, it seems more logical that it fell yesterday because financial conditions are tightening due to higher inflation expectations, with wider spreads driving the dollar to strengthen.If this sounds familiar, we have discussed this here for weeks, maybe months. That is what is happening now. So, absent a collapse in the dollar or rates, I would expect the equity market to continue to struggle, with the decline witnessed thus far only at the start.The
Biotech XBI ETF
has been battered recently, dropping nearly 17% over the past month. This is the ultimate long-duration growth asset class, and the declining XBI ETF tells us how the market is now pricing in higher long-term rates.The S&P 500 closed below the 50-day moving average yesterday and the lower Bollinger band and on support around 5,060. It seems to be a reasonable spot to see the index bounce and restest the 50-day moving average.But again, that will probably depend on rates and the dollar today. Bonds and the dollar may rely on what Jay Powell says today in a moderated discussion at 1:15 PM ET with a Q&A session, along with Tiff Macklem from the Bank of Canada. A break of 5,060 on the S&P 500 can lead to a gap fill at 4,980.More todayOriginal Post"
Investing.com,Gold's Reversal and USD/JPY's Confirmed Breakout,2024-04-15,0.666667,"Golds
huge-volume reversal is definitely THE news that got the spotlight last week. What does it mean?It most likely means that this is it. This was the final top for the price of gold for at least some time. At least thats what the huge-volume sessions meant previously, especially when gold was similarly overbought as it was recently.I marked those periods on the above GLD (NYSE:
GLD
) ETF chart with red  when RSI based on the GLD was over 80 AND we saw a huge spike in the levels of volume, it meant that the big rally in gold price was over.We saw volume spikes in several other cases, and RSI was very overbought in other instances as well, but it is the combination of both that makes that current case  and its three analogies so special.RSI well above 70 indicates a red-hot sentiment, and the extremely high-volume level proves that it reached its extreme as so much capital / gold exchanged hands.Besides, gold didnt only (as if it was a small feat, and it isnt!) move on huge volume while being extremely overbought. It also reversed on that huge volume, which means that the latter confirmed that reversal.And gold even reversed right above the price levels that were likely to mark the end of the rally based on how far gold rallied previously and based on the Fibonacci extension techniques based on the previous price extremes.Gold moved above the target area based on those techniques only briefly, and it reversed shortly thereafter, closing the week back within the area.I previously wrote that gold would be likely to end its rally when we see a breakout in the
USD/JPY
, and that breakout was just confirmed.Friday was the third consecutive day when the currency pair closed above its 2022 and 2023 highs, and it was also the weekly close  this makes the breakout confirmed. Indeed, the pair is moving higher also today.There was a time when the USD/YEN was also after a major breakout, and it was starting a huge rally And you know what happened to gold, then?That was in 2021 and it was when gold was starting one of its biggest declines of the past decades.It might not have to repeat to the letter, but it IS likely to have a big bearish impact on gold prices in the following weeks and months."
Investing.com,S&P 500 E-Mini Forms Consecutive Bear Bars,2024-04-15,0.222222,"The
S&P 500 Futures
weekly chart formed an Emini consecutive bear bar, something that has not happened since October 2023. The bulls want to get at least a small retest of the prior trend extreme high (Mar 21), even if it only leads to a lower high. The will bears need to continue creating strong consecutive bear bars to indicate that they are back in control."
Investing.com,"Warning Signs Flashing as Retail Stocks, Junk Bonds Crack Key Levels",2024-04-15,0.333333,"Last weekend the title of the Daily was:
Economic Modern Family-Warning Signs End of Week.At the time the theory was:Looking at the 6 weekly charts, I updated the horizontal, parallel lines to show that at these higher levels, all the Family are rangebound when you study the patterns from late February to now.Depending on how the consolidation levels break (up and down) it is easier to then trade by following the money.The sector we were most concerned about was Granny Retail
XRT
. Granny Retail XRT sits right on the bottom of the consolidation range at around 74.50.We were also concerned with junk bonds
HYG
. Rangebound junk bonds HYG weekly chart also shows us that under 76.50 risk begins to show more risk off.As you can see from the updated charts, Granny Retail XRT broke the consolidation range.HYG junk bonds broke the consolidation range.For junk bonds, until the price returns over the low of the weekly trading range, caution is warranted.Clearly, Biotechnology continued its downswing and has the distinction of being the first sector to break that weekly consolidation.But what about the others?What should we look for this week?First lets start with
Bitcoin
.This is the month of the halving. Notice how the weekly consolidation range between 60k-72k remains intact.That should make the next moves obvious. With a bit more patience you will see if Bitcoin will hold support and breakout above the top of the range or continue to chop within the range.Regardless, right now there is relative strength here.For Granny Retail XRT we first want to see her hold the 200-WMA at around 71.00. But until she makes her way back over 74.50 area, we are cautious on equities.The
Russell 2000
(
IWM
) Granddad generally follows Grannys lead. Hence, under 200 we are cautious, and back above that level, friendlier.Biotechnology
IBB
, already weak, now must hold its 50-WMA or around 129.Semiconductors
SMH
remain strongest as one would expect. 210-240 is the current trading range. That tells us if the market is to hold, SMH will be the first to pop.What bulls do not want to see is SMH break below the range.Transportation
IYT
tests the bottom of its weekly consolidation range. Interestingly, a relatively strong Family performer, but on alert for a breakdown.Regional Banks
KRE
are most interesting to me. Friday began with a lot of bank earnings. Most of the reports were solid. Nonetheless, all the banks opened lower and remained so throughout the session.KRE is still slightly above the weekly trading range. With long bond yields a bit softer, it is possible to see this sector hold up with a very low-risk entry point against the 50-WMA."
Investing.com,Yen and Gold Plunge While USD Soars  Next Big Moves to Watch out for,2024-04-10,0.666667,"Weve got it! We have the breakout in the
USD/JPY
pair, and gold  in a completely unsurprising way  declined.And that IS a game-changer, even if many people fail to view it as such.This time, the trigger came from the inflation numbers that were above the expected levels and the market now is pricing the scenarios in which the Fed doesnt cut rates as quickly as it had previously been expected.In consequence, the U.S. dollars value increases while
gold
decreases. The
S&P 500 Index
futures declined as well.The technical set-up was in place for days, and it didnt really matter what kind of event or statistic triggered the move  it seems that the CPI did the trick, but in reality, the reason for the strength in the
USD
and the declines in gold and stocks were known previously, based on multiple technical indications. At least those who followed my analyses were prepared.We took profits from the recent long position in gold when gold rallied to $2,342 (but gold then moved higher before the end of the day, so the odds are that my subscribers took profits at even higher gold prices), and two days ago I wrote the following:Gold price reversed its course yesterday in a classic way (shooting star candlestick), but since we saw those reversals a few times recently and they didnt result in declines, I didnt focus on yesterdays pattern Until I saw a change in the regular events earlier today.Today is the first day since March 25 when gold hasnt made a new intraday high. And given whats happening in the currency sector, it might not be able to make that high at all. Perhaps it will be able to move to new highs only after many weeks (months?) of declines. Well see about that when gold approaches its previous highs.For now, its quite clear that gold has indeed topped in the upper part of my target area (okay, it moved a few dollars above it, but not more than that) and that the huge downswing has already begun. Of course, since its just started, its not big yet. Which means that the trading opportunity is still here.Lets take a closer look at the key technical event of todays session:Ladies and gentlemen, we have a breakout!In my previous analyses, I wrote that its quite likely that the rally in gold would continue while the USD/YEN continues to consolidate, and then I expected gold to start to decline once the USD/YEN breaks to new highs.Thats exactly what just happened. The USD/YEN rate just rallied sharply above its 2022 and 2023 highs, and gold turned south.So far, the slide in gold has been relatively small, just as the size of the rally in the USD/YEN is, but breakouts are important for a reason  this is just the first step of another big climb in the currency rate, suggesting that the decline in gold has only begun.The USD Index is soaring as well, but it is the USD/YENs breakout that makes this rally so special.The trade that I had featured previously is over, and if you managed to profit from it  congratulations.And if youre interested in the NEXT big (and likely quick) trade in gold, I have good news for you  this move is just getting started, and the opportunity is still here."
Investing.com,"Hot CPI Ahead? Energy, Consumer Goods Prices to Add Pressure to Today's Data",2024-04-10,0.666667,"Stocks had a back-and-forth day ahead of todays
CPI
report, which could take on some extra weight regarding the outlook for rate cuts.Expectations are for the
CPI
to rise by 0.3% m/m, down from 0.4% m/m last month, while rising by 3.4%, up from 3.2%. Meanwhile, the
core CPI
is forecast to rise by 0.3% m/m, down from 0.4% last month, and by 3.7% y/y, down from 3.8%.The swaps market has been pretty consistent here and still thinks the CPI comes in at 3.4% on the y/y headline number and by 0.3% m/m.The deciding factor on the headline CPI rate will probably be energy and good prices. Those have been the big disinflation narrative in recent months, and gasoline prices have risen significantly in March.Additionally, we saw goods inflation come back to life in February, which followed that significant increase in shipping costs. Last month was the first time since May 2023 that there was a positive reading on the CPI commodities, less food and energy.In the meantime, the
S&P 500
was all over the place yesterday, opening higher and dropping sharply midday only to snap back into the close.Im not sure what drove the end-of-day part of the day. Bostic was making comments around 3:25 PM ET, but the rally started well before that.The
VIX
1-day finished higher on the day, closing around 18 and up 8 points, so it was a big move. One would expect the VIX 1D value to drop sharply today; how far it drops will likely determine if the equity market rallies.We saw a rally following the Job report and a rally following last months CPI report, so given the VIX 1-day level yesterday, it seems possible to see a rally today, even if the CPI number isnt favorable, on a volatility reset.We will have a
10-year
auction today at 1 PM, following the CPI report. The
3-year
auction wasnt great yesterday with indirect acceptance coming in low at 60%, and the two bps tail on the high yield rate.Clearly, with the risk of the CPI report removed from the equation, we could see a better auction today.The 10-year closed yesterday at 4.36%, so right on support. It seems evident that if the 10-year break support is at 4.35%, it could drop further to around 4.15%, with resistance around 4.5% to 4.55%.Today, we will also get the Fed
minutes
, which have been mostly forgotten, it seems. I think the minutes will show that the Feds consensus was much closer to 2 rate cuts than the three rate cuts seen in the dot plot. Additionally, it should give us some clues on the pace of the QT slowdown.Original Post"
Investing.com,Margin Debt Surges as Bulls Leverage Bets,2024-04-09,0.555556,"In the most recent report from FINRA, margin debt levels have surged as bullish investors leverage their bets in the equity market. The increase in leverage is not surprising, as it represents increased risk-taking by investors in the stock market.We
previously discussed that valuations
, in the short term, reflect investor optimism. In other words, as prices increase, investors rationalize why paying more for current earnings is rational.The same holds for margin debt. Unsurprisingly, as consumer confidence improves, so does the speculative demand for equities. As stock markets improve, the fear of missing out becomes more prevalent. Such boosts demand for equities, and as prices rise, investors take on more risk by adding leverage.Adding to that exuberance is the increased demand for share repurchases, which has been a primary source of
buying
since 2000.As CEO confidence improves, a byproduct of increased consumer confidence, they increase the demand for share repurchases. As buybacks boost asset prices, investors take on more leverage and increase exposure as a virtual spiral develops.However, should investors be afraid of rising margin debt?Before we dig further into what margin debt tells us, lets begin with where we are currently. There is clear evidence that investors are once again highly exuberant.The Fear Greed index below differs from the CNN measure in that our model measures positioning in the market by how much professional and retail investors are exposed to equity risk.Currently, that exposure is at levels associated with investors being
all in
the equity
pool.As Howard Marks noted in a December 2020 Bloomberg interview:Of course, in 2021, that market continued its low volatility grind higher as investors took on increasing margin debt levels to chase higher equities. However, this is the crucial point about margin debt.Margin debt is not a technical indicator for trading markets. What it represents is the amount of speculation occurring in the market. In other words, margin debt is the
gasoline,
which drives markets higher as the leverage provides for the additional purchasing power of assets.
However, leverage also works in reverse, as it supplies the accelerant for more significant declines as lenders force the sale of assets to cover credit lines without regard to the borrowers position.The last sentence is the most important.
The issue with margin debt is that the unwinding of leverage is NOT at the investors discretion.
That process is at the discretion of the broker-dealers that extended that leverage in the first place.(In other words, if you dont sell to cover, the broker-dealer will do it for you.) When lenders fear they may not recoup their credit lines, they force the borrower to put in more cash or sell assets to cover the debt. The problem is that
margin calls
generally happen simultaneously, as falling asset prices impact all lenders simultaneously.Margin debt is NOT an issue  until it is.As shown, Howard was eventually right. In 2022, the decline wiped out all of the previous years gains and then some.So, where are we currently?As noted, margin debt supports the advance when markets are rising and investors are taking on additional leverage to increase buying power. Therefore, the recent rise in margin debt is unsurprising as investor exuberance climbs.The chart shows the relationship between cash balances and the market. I have inverted free cash balances, so the relationship between increases in margin debt and the market is better represented.
(Free cash balances are the difference between margin balances less cash and credit balances in margin accounts.)Note that during the 1987 correction, the 2015-2016 
Brexit/Taper Tantrum,
the 2018 
Rate Hike Mistake,
and the 
COVID Dip,
the market never broke its uptrend, AND cash balances never turned positive.Both a break of the rising bullish trend and positive free cash balances were the 2000 and 2008 bear market hallmarks. With negative cash balances shy of another all-time high, the next downturn could be another
correction.
However, if, or when, the long-term bullish trend is broken, the unwinding of margin debt will add
fuel to the fire.While the immediate response to this analysis will be,
But Lance, margin debt isnt as high as it was previously,
there are many differences between today and 2021. The lack of stimulus payments, zero interest rates, and $120 billion in monthly
Quantitative Easing
 are just a few. However, some glaring similarities exist, including the surge in negative cash balances and extreme deviations from long-term means.In the short term, exuberance is infectious. The more the market rallies, the more risk investors want to take on. The issue with margin debt is that when an event eventually occurs, it creates a rush to liquidate holdings. Since margin debt is a function of the value of the underlying
collateral,
the forced sale of assets will reduce the value of the collateral. The decline in value then triggers further margin calls, triggering more selling, forcing more margin calls, and so forth.Margin debt levels, like valuations, are not useful as a market-timing device. However, they are a valuable indicator of market exuberance.While it may
feel
like the market
just wont go down,
it is worth remembering Warren Buffetts sage words."
Investing.com,"US Retail Sales Surge, China's GDP Soars, Fed Rate Cut Speculation Wanes",2024-04-16,0.666667,"A stronger-than-expected retail sales data from the US cemented the idea that the US economy remains too strong for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut the rates in summer. Retail sales jumped 0.7% in March on a monthly basis, more than 4% on a yearly basis, the 3 and 6-month bill auctions were weak, and Atlanta Feds GDPNow forecast rebounded to 2.8%. Not bad.Then, China posted a surprisingly stronger-than-expected GDP number this morning, showing that the Chinese economy grew 5.3% in the first quarter, comfortably higher than a 4.8% growth penciled in by analysts. But the sky is not blue in China. The industrial production missed estimates, house prices continue to fall and consumer spending slowed significantly during March, hinting that the underlying problems  like property crisis and weak consumer confidence - are not going away. Remember, Fitch cut the countrys outlook to negative last week citing risks to public finances, while in contrast Goldman and Morgan Stanley raised their outlook for the countrys economic growth pointing at improved factory activity and recovery in exports. But the EU started a deluge of investigations on China that could hurt the countrys export outlook, along with the risk of seeing Donald Trump become the next US president. The contradictory expectations and mixed data explained why the CSI 300 slid despite a 5.3% GDP growth. Shanghais Composite fell almost 1.5%.A strong Chinese GDP may have not boosted appetite for Chinese stocks, but it sure boosts worries that rising Chinese growth  regardless of where growth comes from  will fuel global inflation and make major central banks think twice about their rate-cutting plans. While the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) are seen cutting the rates between summer and fall respectively, the outlook becomes complicated for the US. Provided that the economic growth and jobs market remain robust and inflation is heating up, the idea that the Feds next move will be a rate hike starts cooking in many investors minds. UBS now thinks that the Fed could increase borrowing costs to 6.5% next year to combat inflation. The fading Fed cut expectations continue to pressure the treasury market. The
US 2-year
yield is preparing to jump sustainably above the 5% level, the
10-year
yield advanced past the 4.60% and the
US Dollar Index
extends gains. The
EUR/USD
is trading a touch below 1.0615 this morning with euro bears eyeing a further decline to 1.05 level, while the
USD/JPY
spiked above 154  the unthinkable at the start of the year  as the yen bears defy the Japanese authorities intervention threats and T. Rowe Price calls for another 10% slide in the Japanese yen.In equities, the
S&P 500
had a bad start to the week with a 1.20% decline, as technology stocks led losses.
Nasdaq
fell 1.65%. Both the indices slipped below their 50-DMA following yesterdays selloff. While strong economic data is not necessarily bad news for company earnings  as consumers continue to spend  the rising inflation, the fading dovish Fed expectations, and the latest optimism regarding earnings expectations could limit the upside potential in major stock indices, if company results fail to beat high expectations. The fear sets in and the
VIX index
rises rapidly.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:
GS
) surprised in the Q1 with a 28% jump in profit, but JPM and Wells Fargos first-quarter results didnt enchant investors. BoFA and Morgan Stanley will release their quarterly results in the coming hours. BoFA may announce a narrowing net interest margin, as did JPM and Wells Fargo, while Morgan Stanley is expected to post its 9thconsecutive quarterly drop in earnings. Later this week, Netflix (NASDAQ:
NFLX
) will begin the dance for the major tech earnings, Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) is due to reveal its Q1 results next week.Tesla said that it will cut 10% of its workforce globally to adjust to slowing EV demand. In fact, the company has had a bad quarter, deliveries fell 8.5% while the global EV sales increased less than 3%. Tesla lost market share despite cutting the prices of its electric cars. Losing market share despite lowering prices calls for immediate action to increase profitability. Price increases and cost-cutting are the first aid measures that should soothe investors nerves, while bringing forward new revenue streams like robotaxis should keep investors dreaming for a bright future. Yet, the context of slowing EV growth and rising competition will likely continue to weigh on profits, and robotaxis are a niche and a slowly growing segment which wont show in the bottom line in the immediate future. Therefore, Tesla  which has a PE ratio of nearly 62, has room to extend losses to settle at a more reasonable valuation. A slide toward the 100 is possible."
Investing.com,AI and Bitcoin,2024-04-15,0.555556,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and
Bitcoin
were top of mind at last weeks Paris Blockchain Week, where I had the privilege of presenting to an enthusiastic crowd. The blockchain and digital assets event, held beneath the world-famous Louvre Museum, attracted close to 10,000 people, an impressive 25% increase over last year, as Bitcoin traded near its all-time high and AI dominated headlines.To give you an idea of just how explosive AI has been in the public consciousness, especially since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, consider the chart below, which compares Google (NASDAQ:
GOOGL
) searches for AI and Bitcoin. Post-ChatGPT, peoples interest in learning more about AI has gone parabolic.My presentation focused on the transformative potential of Bitcoin and AI through the lens of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory, highlighting how these nascent technologies are already reshaping our world in profound ways. By exploring some of the key features of CASincluding decentralization, network effects and nonlinear dynamicsI sought to show how Bitcoin and AI are prime examples of complex systems whose influence on our lives will only continue to grow.Ultimately, my goal was to leave attendees with a renewed sense of excitement and optimism for AI and Bitcoin. I genuinely believe that, if done right, these technologies can help us build a future thats more opportunistic, fair and sustainable.A good example of what Im talking about are smart contracts. These self-executing applications, which are still in their infancy, have the potential to streamline complex transactions, increase efficiency and reduce costs.Doug Levin, serial entrepreneur and Executive-in-Residence at Harvard Business School, laid out the perfect use case for smart contracts in the oil industry. According to Levin, these contracts could incorporate different transactions occurring automatically at different prices, based on varying market conditions. This has the power to create a fairer, more efficient and transparent marketplace for both oil buyers and sellers.The efficiency of blockchain transactions is already evident. A few years ago, everyone was astonished to learn that a $1 billion transaction between two anonymous Bitcoin wallets settled in under an hour with a fee of only $700. Meanwhile, moving money from a New York bank to a Paris bank can still take up to a week to fully settle.Looking further into the future, Ryan Condron, creator of the Lumerin protocol, shared his thought-provoking vision of the world where everyone has their own personalized AI that knows everything about them, from childhood to, well, the very end. Theoretically, this AI could continue to make investment decisions and deploy capital on that persons behalf, even after they were gone, based on their preferences and the AI's deep understanding of who they were during their lifetime.With AI, paired with Bitcoin, maybe youll be able to take it with you after all.In case you missed it, Elon Musk made a bold yet plausible prediction last week regarding AI, saying he believes the technology will become smarter than the smartest human by next year or 2026 at the latest. I dont know who the smartest human currently living is, but if (and when) this happens, we may need to redefine what it means to be smart.The Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) chiefs forecast might not come as a surprise to anyone whos been paying attention. For months now, AI has been able to pass a number of rigorous human tests, including the Uniform Bar Exam (UBE). In February, a team of researchers reported that the most recent version of ChatGPT exhibits characteristics that are statistically indistinguishable from a random human. Way before that, in 1997, IBMs Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov.Another highly influential business leader, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, also weighed in on AI last week. In his annual letter to shareholders, Dimon speculated that the technology has the potential to be as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years, citing examples such as the printing press and the internet.I agree whole-heartedly with Dimon on this point, even if I dont agree with his negative views on Bitcoin. The worlds largest digital asset poses a serious challenge to his business, and its easy to imagine that Dimon, as CEO of the worlds largest bank, sees his role as protector of centralized finance, fiat currency and the traditional banking system.Interestingly, Dimon raises a number of major risks in his letterfrom record-high government debt to political polarization to escalating global tensionsthat could also double as reasons to own an uncorrelated asset like Bitcoin.As one Bitcoin-related X account quipped, Jamie Dimon is a #Bitcoin salesman and doesnt even know it.From smart contracts that streamline complex transactions to personalized AI assistants that can make decisions on our behalf, the possibilities of AI are endless. And with the added security and decentralization provided by Bitcoin, we may be on the cusp of a new era of financial freedom and innovation.Theres a lot of doom and gloom surrounding Bitcoin and AI, but I choose to approach them with a sense of optimism, and I hope you choose to do so as well.***Past performance does not guarantee future results.Holdings may change daily.

Investing.com,Futures Market Indicates Rate Cuts Off the Table in the Near Term,2024-04-15,0.222222,"In the wake of last weeks hotter-than-expected
consumer inflation data for March
, the implied forecast via Fed funds futures indicates that interest-rate cuts are unlikely in the months ahead.Using early-Monday-morning prices as a guide, the implied probability is heavily skewed toward no rate cuts for the next two FOMC meetings in May and June. For the September policy meeting the current forecast is too close to call and is a coin toss in terms of guesstimating.The current outlook marks a conspicuous change from just a week ago (Mar. 8), when futures were pricing in a moderate probability of a cut by September.The policy-sensitive
US 2-year
Treasury yield has also downgraded prospects for a near-term rate cut. This key yield for evaluating the policy outlook jumped sharply last week, closing at 4.88% on Friday (Apr. 12), close to a five-month high.Traders are closely watching the spread between the 2-year yield and effective Fed funds rate for insight into how the outlook for policy evolves. Notably, the gap between these rates has recently narrowed significantly after the 2-year yield rebounded  a sign that the market is downgrading the odds for a near-term rate cut.Two key questions hang over the outlook for rate-cuts. First, is the hawkish reaction to last weeks consumer inflation data for April excessive?Meanwhile, how does the Iranian missile attack on Israel alter the calculus?If the attack marks the start of a wider Middle East war, will it trigger a run for safety in global markets that lifts demand for Treasuries (and reduce yields), if only temporarily?For the moment, the world is closely monitoring how and when Israel will react. Israel cant allow such a large attack over Israel without some kind of response, be it small or large, an Israeli official in the prime ministers office tells NBC News. Its up to the war Cabinet to decide now."

Investing.com,Gold Rallies on Safe-Haven Demand as Middle-East Tensions Escalate; Euro Slumps,2024-04-15,0.333333,"On Friday, the gold (XAU) price surged above 2,400 but lost most of the gains in the American session and declined by 0.39%.As tensions in the Middle East intensified, investors fled to safe-haven assetsgold and the
US dollar
.Iran attacked Israel over the weekend, but it isn't yet clear whether Israel will retaliate. Either way, traders should pay attention to developments surrounding the Middle East conflict, given that the US monetary policy outlook now seems to have less impact on
XAU/USD
.Indeed, due to strong US macroeconomic data, investors have scaled back their rate cut expectations and are now pricing in only a 22% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in June. Previously, this would have been perceived as a negative factor for gold. However, the combination of geopolitical risks and central banks' plans to diversify their reserves is now pushing the gold price higher.XAU/USD was essentially flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the economic calendar features some important data releases from the US, but developments from the Middle East will likely overshadow any reports. Still, the US Retail Sales and the Empire State Manufacturing Index will be released at 12:30 p.m. UTC. Better-than-expected figures will decrease the chances that the Fed will ease its policy in July, possibly putting downward pressure on the gold price. Otherwise, the data might trigger another bullish impulse in XAU/USD. However, the pair is technically overbought.Wang Tao at analyst Reuters said,Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade said,Last week, the euro (EUR) experienced its largest weekly percentage decline since late September 2022.Last week, the euro experienced significant losses against the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, against the British pound. The decline was primarily fuelled by the European Central Bank's (ECB) dovish remarks at the last monetary policy meeting. Additionally, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East further contributed to the euro's fall. The possibility that the ECB will begin easing rates before the Federal Reserve (Fed) negatively impacts
EUR/USD
. There were signs that the Fed might also lower rates in June, but unexpectedly high US CPI figures and strong labor market data have shifted this outlook. Thus, a more hawkish stance on US interest rates has strengthened the US dollar. Boston Fed President Susan Collins stated on Friday that she expects around 2 rate cuts in 2024, as opposed to the previously expected 3 rate reductions.Over the weekend, Iran responded to an alleged Israeli strike on its consulate in Syria. The market has remained relatively stable despite these developments, probably because Iran had warned about planning an attack in advance, helping to prevent further escalation. The US dollar strengthened as geopolitical tensions spurred safe-haven demand, exerting downward pressure on EUR/USD.EUR/USD was essentially unchanged in the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders should pay attention to the US Retail Sales report at 12:30 p.m. UTC. The report will provide insights into the pace of US inflation, potentially influencing investors' interest rate expectations and affecting EUR/USD. If the data exceed expectations, the chances of a rate cut by the Fed in autumn may decrease, possibly leading to a drop in EUR/USD below 1.06300. Conversely, lower-than-expected figures could increase the prospects of an imminent rate cut, reversing EUR/USD's bearish trend and pushing the pair towards 1.07000.The Australian dollar (AUD) plunged by more than 2% on Friday as the US dollar rallied due to risk-off flows as conflict in the Middle East has escalated.The bullish trend in
AUD/USD
, which has been in place since October 2023, is now broken. Geopolitical uncertainty has triggered safe-haven demand, and investors have turned away from risk-sensitive currencies, such as the Australian dollar. In addition, the divergence in monetary policies also favors the US dollar. According to the interest rate swap market data, traders expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut its base rate by just 44 basis points (bps) in 2024 but anticipate around 55 bps worth of cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Still, it's highly improbable that the RBA will decide to reduce the cash rate before the Fed, as inflation in Australia remains above the official target and may increase further due to rising energy costs.AUD/USD was rising slightly during the Asian and early European session, but the 0.65000 mark continues to act as strong resistance. Today, several economic reports from the US may trigger volatility in AUD/USD. At 12:30 p.m. UTC, the US will publish its regular Retail Sales report and Empire State Manufacturing Index. Better-than-expected results are likely to bring AUD/USD below 0.64500. However, weaker-than-expected figures may push the pair towards 0.65000, but it may be challenging for the pair to hold above this level."
Investing.com,Middle East War Escalates,2024-04-15,0.666667,"The retraction of global markets on Friday and this morning in Asia and Europe are rational risk-rebalancing moves, considering that the heartbreaking events in the Middle East present the potential to destabilize various essential parts of the global supply chain.The primary concern at present is the looming threat of a significant surge in
oil prices
, a scenario that could be triggered by the escalating tension in the Strait of Hormuz. This waterway, a vital artery for the global supply chain, is also bordered by Oman, where tensions are likewise mounting. This situation is compelling investors to stock up on oil supplies, in anticipation of a potential closure of this crucial corridor.In this sense, the current scenario imposes a greater threat to global energy supply chains than the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, which does not directly impact any vital oil pipelines.From a stock market perspective, the risks impending from this scenario are further boosted by the resilience of inflation in the US, as seen in the latest
CPI
report.A significant escalation in oil prices could potentially prolong the current interest rate cycle of the US central bank, which could have far-reaching implications from a macroeconomic standpoint.However, even more significant is the discussion about a broader movement in the worlds geopolitical landscape that has the power to transform global trade as we have grown accustomed to seeing.After decades of increasing proximity between the worlds economies, recent movements like Chinas post-COVID economic matrix shift, Russias seizure of Western trade, and Latin Americas nearshoring boom indicate that the world may be taking significant steps towards a more deglobalized perspective.Not coincidentally, JP Morgans CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in his annual letter about the potential risks of such movements for the global economys long-term outlook.While the current perspective is, in strictly economic terms, inflationary in itself, it has also prompted central banks globally to reconsider the quality of the underlying assets supporting their balance sheets. For instance, China has been trading US treasuries for gold at one of the fastest paces in history, helping real rates stay at significantly high levels.Faced with all these risks, investors rationally tend to reallocate some investments into assets historically treated as lower riskthese being
gold
, other commodities of finite supply (like oil itself), the
US dollar
, and the
Japanese yen
as well as real estate.In recent years,
Bitcoin
has also emerged as an alternative. However, cryptocurrencies have still proven to be very sensitive to interest rate cycles, which may hinder this proposition.Within the stock market, the defense sector is likely to gain interest due to the probable increase in military spending by various countries.While the human situation is heartbreaking and demands swift and immediate action toward peace, investors must stay calm when thinking strictly from an investment perspective.In this sense, the aforementioned factors speak more of a risk-rebalancing approach to investing than of an urgent need for a complete change in portfolio composition or a deeper risk-off move.As Dimon wisely pointed out in his annual letter, When terrible events happen, we tend to overestimate the effect they will have on the global economy.While the long-term investment proposition remains unchanged, it is prudent to continuously monitor and address macroeconomic risks within ones portfolio, ensuring a sound and forward-looking approach to investment strategy.Our hearts and prayers go to our friends and colleagues in Israel. May this situation change promptly, and may good times return swiftly, bringing peace and stability to the region.***Disclaimer:

Investing.com,Market Dynamics Post-Iranian Strike,2024-04-15,0.555556,"Risk appetite is better this Monday morning than it was last Friday when the world was bracing for the Iranian retaliation on Israel. Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles on Israel on Saturday night, but only a small number reached Israel, limiting damages. There were no fatalities, just an army base was slightly damaged. The good news is Tehran called the operation a success and declared that it wouldnt take further action unless Israel responded. Oil traded slightly lower as the first reaction to the weekend news, while gold gapped higher at the open as last weeks rising tensions left a sour taste in investors mouths. Elsewhere, base metals including copper, iron and aluminum surged after the US and the UK decided to impose sanctions on Russian supplies. Spot aluminum jumped more than 5% while
copper futures
advanced to the highest levels since last summer. The
dollar index
consolidated on Monday after a 2% jump last week.The
US dollar
strengthens on the back of a severe deterioration in Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut expectations following strong jobs and inflation data, and the dollar outlook remains comfortably bullish.The
US 2-year
yield hit 5% post-US CPI data, and the probability of a June Fed rate cut fell to around 22%. July cut expectations is around 50-50, and a September rate cut is given around 73% chance.And you know the election narrative that the Fed may not opt for a rate cut approaching the November presidential election, which would delay the first cut to after the election. And some believe that the Feds next move wont be a cut, but a rate hike to tame rising inflationary pressures. Thats a significant readjustment compared to the expectation of six rate cuts in January.While the US data continues to cement the strength of the US economy and the fact the US doesnt need to cut rates  and should not be cutting rates with heating inflation - the rate cut expectations elsewhere remain pretty solid. Last weeks European Central Bank (ECB) meeting gave another hint that the bank will more likely than not cut its own rates in June. ECB Chief Christine Lagarde said that the ECB is data-dependent and not Fed-dependent and other members noted that its time to diverge from the Fed, as the US consumers are relentless  and the US government is very supportive  with Biden looking to cancel $7.4bn in student debt to please young voters before the election.As a result, the gap between the Fed and the ECB rate cut expectations widened to the highest level this year following a dovish ECB stance and another set of strong jobs and inflation read in the US. And the chatter of a further euro depreciation to parity against the US dollar is being brought back on the table. At the current levels, the RSI indicator is very close to the oversold territory, meaning that the euro was sold too rapidly in a too short period of time and a correction could be needed. But most traders will be looking to sell the tops in the
EUR/USD
on the back of the growing divergence between the soft ECB and the Fed  that simply cant justify a rate cut this summer.The
S&P 500
posted its worst weekly performance since late October 2023. Mixed bank earnings didnt help improve mood on Friday. JPM tanked 6.5% as net interest income missed expectations and slipped from the previous quarter as investors chased higher returns. The latter is a real joy killer among investors who were expecting to hear how much more net interest income the bank could gain with a delayed rate cut from the Fed. Similarly, deposits that dont pay interest at Wells Fargo slumped 18% in Q1This week, the earnings season gains momentum with the rest of the US big banks, Netflix (NASDAQ:
NFLX
), and
TSM
due to announce their Q1 results. The expectation is a 3.8% annual growth in S&P 500 companies earnings per share in the Q1, while profits for the Magnificent Seven are expected to have risen around 38%. Another strong quarter in terms of earnings could slow a potential selloff in the S&P500  that sees the selling pressure rise on the back of rising hawkish voices. But a softer-than-expected earnings season will likely trigger profit-taking.Bitcoin
slumped over the weekend as rising geopolitical tensions weighed on risk appetite. Bitcoin halving is expected to happen in the coming days. Lower supply is fundamentally supportive of an assets valuation, but we might not see a clear kneejerk reaction to Bitcoin halving as most of it is already priced in."
