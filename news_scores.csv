Investing.com,Federal Government Runs Another Deficit Despite Record Revenue,2024-02-13,0.333333,"By Mike Maharrey, Money Metals Exchange
The federal government's budget deficit was only $21.93 billion in January.
That was a significant improvement over the $129 billion shortfall recorded in December.
But dont throw the confetti.
The smaller deficit was primarily due to increased government receipts thanks to a big drop in tax refunds. But the Biden administration is still spending like a drunken sailor. (No disrespect to drunken sailors.)
Meanwhile, interest payments on the rapidly ballooning national debt continue to expand at breakneck speed.
Through the first four months of fiscal 2024, the federal government ran a $531.86 trillion deficit, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That is a 16 percent increase over the same period in fiscal 2023.
These massive monthly budget shortfalls are pushing the national debt higher at a dizzying pace. On December 29, the national debt eclipsed $34 trillion for the first time. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5, the national debt stood at a ""mere"" $31.46 trillion. As of Feb. 9, the national debt stood at $34.2 trillion.
According to the CBO, debt held by the public is projected to balloon from $26.2 trillion to $48.3 trillion by the end of 2034. That would represent 116 percent of GDP and would be the highest level on record.The federal government is a little like a drunk dude up late shopping on Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
).
The Treasury reported $477.32 billion in receipts last month, a January record. Collection of payroll and income tax withholdings helped boost government revenue. The IRS has also cleared a backlog of delayed income tax filings from the pandemic year.
But even with this revenue windfall, the U.S. government still ran a deficit. Thats because it is addicted to spending money.
In January, the U.S. Biden administration blew through $499.25 billion, also a January record.These big budget deficits are happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills, and it is likely one of the reasons that the Federal Reserve is talking about rate cuts. The borrow-and-spend U.S. government cant function in a high interest-rate environment.
The U.S. government spent $69.2 billion on interest expenses alone in January. This was more than the amount spent on national defense ($60 billion) and more than healthcare ($68 billion).
Interest on the federal debt came in $96 billion higher through the first four months of the fiscal year than in the same period last year. The government has shelled out $357 billion on interest payments in fiscal 2023. The only category with higher spending was Social Security.
Net interest expense, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, was $283 billion through the first four months of the fiscal year, still nearly as much as the government spent on national defense ($298 billion).
And interest expense will only continue to climb.
Much of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month, some of that super-low-yielding paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates.
The weighted average interest rate on the governments outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.21 percent as of the end of January. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.43 percent in January 2022.
Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words, the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
And it's only going to get worse unless the Fed quickly ratchets down interest rates.
Interest expense will continue to rise at a rapid rate as more and more Treasuries mature and are replaced by higher-yielding bonds.
The only way out of this fiscal death spiral is significant spending cuts and/or major tax hikes.
I wouldnt hold my breath.
And I would hold on to my confetti."

prices  from $2.2 to $2 for a MMBTU. However, I foresee that the price may become even lower. With a sharp reduction of exports, the price of gas will fall to the range of $1.5 - 1.8.
What are the main reasons for this price decrease? Between 2009 and 2022, the drilling speed saw a fivefold increase. The studied area has expanded, allowing for precise well modeling. Moreover, equipment productivity and capacity have risen, accompanied by a reduction in equipment costs. Consequently, the expense of drillhole construction has halved, while productivity has surged ten times.
The new low price will stop both the introduction of new wells and drilling increase. And accordingly, there will be a cut in production for the month and price stabilization. The excess gas will be pumped into the underground storage. The injection can be kept there for a month and during this period there will be a decline in production. Subsequently, in spite of the current drop, we can expect the average gas price in 2024 in the United States at the level of $2.6 - 2.8 for a MMBtu."

Investing.com,The Ninja Price Increase - Shrinkflation,2024-01-16,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
You know all about price inflation and how it squeezes your wallet. But there are also ninja price increases out there that you might not notice. It's called ""shrinkflation.""
Inflation robs you of purchasing power by driving up the price of everything you buy. The government reports price inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) but it's a lot worse than they're telling you.
In the first place, the CPI is rigged to understate the extent of price inflation. You probably realize this every time you go to the store.
But price inflation also manifests itself in ways a government formula could never capture, and you may not even notice. Not only do you pay more for everything you buy, you get less.Literally.
And that's called shrinkflation.
Consumers aren't the only ones struggling with rising prices. Producers have to deal with them as well. The cost of materials, labor, and equipment go up, putting the squeeze on companies' bottom lines. Eventually, they have to pass those costs on to their customers.
But raising prices isn't a popular move. Ideally, a company would love to hide the price increase from you.
Enter shrinkflation.
Instead of raising the price, the company just gives you less for the same amount of money. It does this by shrinking packages or putting less stuff in the same size container.Shrinkflation doesnt show up in the CPI, and most of the time, you probably dont even notice. But the effect is the same as rising prices. You ultimately end up with less stuff.
It is stealth inflation.
Here's a recent example courtesy of Campbell's Soup.But as my friend astutely pointed out, it is ""part and parcel"" of a bigger picture and it reveals exactly what the government is doing to your money as a matter of policy.
The devaluation of the dollar manifests itself everywhere in ways we dont even expect or measure. The consumer price index measures inflation charitably by allowing, at their discretion, for the use of substitute goods and services to offset price increases. There are no aggregate metrics to account for the decrease in quality of goods, for shrinkflation, and the precipitous declines were experiencing in the quality and formerly personal nature of important services.
MousePrint.org chronicles shrinkflation. Here are some recent examples.Most of the time, consumers don't even notice shrinkflation. But when they do, they get mad. And their anger is usually directed at the greedy corporations that are charging them the same for less.
But there's another culprit.
The Federal Reserve.
Price inflation is a symptom of monetary inflation. As the central bank creates money out of thin air and injects it into the economy, prices generally rise. Economist Murray Rothbard noted that since governments have deemed paper tickets and ""computer digits"" money, then the government, as dominant money-supplier, becomes free to create money costlessly and at will. As a result, this inflation of the money supply destroys the value of the dollar or pound, drives up prices, cripples economic calculation, and hobbles and seriously damages the workings of the market economy.
Companies can't just ignore their cost problems. They can either raise prices, which will make you mad, or shrink package sizes, which will still make you mad, but you might not notice.
But the end result is always the same. You end up paying more and getting less."
Investing.com,Biden Admin. Runs Half Trillion Dollar Deficit in Q1 of Fiscal 2024,2024-01-12,0.222222,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
Just one quarter into fiscal 2024, the federal government has already run a budget deficit of over half a trillion dollars.
The December budget shortfall came in at $129.37 billion, according to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement. That drove the 2024 deficit to $509.94 billion. Thats a 21 percent increase over the first quarter deficit in fiscal 2023.
This follows on the heels of the third-largest annual budget deficit in history (1.7 trillion).
These massive monthly budget shortfalls are pushing the national debt higher at a dizzying pace. On December 29, the national debt eclipsed $34 trillion for the first time. When Congress effectively eliminated the debt ceiling on June 5, the national debt stood at a ""mere"" $31.46 trillion.President Joe Biden blames Republican tax cuts under the Trump administration for the ever-widening budget deficit, but the numbers dont bear this out. Federal receipts were just under $1.1 trillion in the first quarter. Thats 12 percent higher than through the first three months of fiscal 2023.
Federal revenue did decline in fiscal 2023 after a windfall in 2022. According to a Tax Foundation analysis of Congressional Budget Office data, federal tax collections were up 21 percent in fiscal 22. Tax collections also came in at a multi-decade high of 19.6 percent as a share of GDP. But at the time, CBO analysts warned the good times wouldnt last.
And they didnt.
Government receipts fell by 9.3 percent in fiscal 2023. Even so, receipts are up so far this year even as the deficit climbed.
The real problem is on the spending side of the ledger. Over the last two years, the Biden administration has blown through roughly half a trillion every single month.
Through the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the federal government spent $1.62 trillion. Thats a 12 percent increase over the first three months of last year.Excessive borrowing and spending is a bipartisan sport.
This underscores the fact that the fundamental issue isnt that the U.S. government doesnt have enough money. The fundamental problem is that the U.S. government spends too much money. Despite the pretend spending cuts, and promises from the Biden administration that it would save hundreds of billions the debt ceiling deal (aka the [misnamed]
Fiscal Responsibility Act
) didnt address that problem. No matter what you hear about spending cuts, the federal government always finds new reasons to spend more money.These big budget deficits are happening during a time of sharply rising interest rates. This is a big problem for a government that primarily depends on borrowing to pay its bills, and it is likely one of the reasons that the Federal Reserve is talking about rate cuts even though the CPI remains well above the mythical 2 percent target. The borrow-and-spend U.S. government cant function in a high interest-rate environment.
Uncle Sam spent $288.01 billion in interest expense to finance the national debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. That was more than national defense ($238 billion) and more than Medicare ($168 billion). The only higher spending category was Social Security at $351 billion.
Net interest expense, excluding intragovernmental transfers to trust funds, was $216 billion in Q1, still nearly as much as the government spent on national defense.
Much of the debt currently on the books was financed at very low rates before the Federal Reserve started its hiking cycle. Every month, some of that super-low-yielding paper matures and has to be replaced by bonds yielding much higher rates. The weighted average interest rate on the governments outstanding Treasury securities rose to 3.17 percent as of the end of December. That compares with a weighted average rate of 2.32 percent in December 2022.
Rising interest rates drove interest payments to over 35 percent as a percentage of total tax receipts in fiscal 2023. In other words, the government is already paying more than a third of the taxes it collects on interest expense.
And it's only going to get worse.
Interest expense will continue to rise at a rapid rate as more and more Treasuries mature and are replaced by higher-yielding bonds.
The only way out of this fiscal death spiral is significant spending cuts and/or major tax hikes. Congress doesnt seem to have the political will for either."
Investing.com,The Common Definition of Inflation Is Wrong - It's Just Government Propaganda,2024-01-12,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
The Consumer Price Index for December came in hotter than expected but its a lot lower than it was a year ago. That means inflation is decreasing, right?
Not so fast.
Its important to understand that the term inflation as bandied about by government people and the mainstream financial media is vague and imprecise. The word simply means an increase. But an increase in what?When government officials and pundits on TV talk about inflation, they almost always mean price inflation. This is what the CPI attempts to measure  how much prices have generally gone up in the economy. When you hear Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell or some other government official talk about cooling inflation, theyre simply saying that prices are not rising as fast as measured by the CPI.
But historically, inflation didnt mean rising prices. Inflation was defined more precisely as an increase in the amount of money and credit in the economy, or more succinctly, an expansion in the money supply.Economist Ludwig von Mises defined it this way in his essay ""
Inflation: An Unworkable Fiscal Policy
.""
Inflation, as this term was always used everywhere and especially in this country, means increasing the quantity of money and bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check.
A 1970s dictionary offered this definition of inflation.
A sharp increase in the amount of money and credit causing advances in the price level.
Notice in this definition that rising prices are the result of inflation  not inflation itself.
This is an extremely important distinction that has been almost entirely erased in the modern definition of inflation.
Henry Hazlitt is best known for his brilliant book 
Economics in One Lesson
. In another essay titled 
Inflation in One Page,
 he explained why using a more precise definition of inflation is crucial.
Inflation is an increase in the quantity of money and credit. Its chief consequence is soaring prices.
Therefore inflationif we misuse the term to mean the rising prices themselvesis caused solely by printing more money. For this the governments monetary policies are entirely responsible.Over the years, government officials, along with government apologists in the mainstream financial media and academia, intentionally shifted the definition of inflation to suit government purposes. The standard definition of inflation you hear during White House press conferences or a CNBC roundtable is basically just government propaganda.
Hazlitt alludes to the reason for this intentional change in definition. Redefining inflation as rising prices allows government people to shift the blame.
Mises explained it this way.
People today use the term `inflation' to refer to the phenomenon that is an inevitable consequence of inflation, that is the tendency of all prices and wage rates to rise.
The result of this deplorable confusion is that there is no term left to signify the cause of this rise in prices and wages. There is no longer any word available to signify the phenomenon that has been, up to now, called inflation As you cannot talk about something that has no name, you cannot fight it.
Those who pretend to fight inflation are in fact only fighting what is the inevitable consequence of inflation, rising prices. Their ventures are doomed to failure because they do not attack the root of the evil. They try to keep prices low while firmly committed to a policy of increasing the quantity of money that must necessarily make them soar.
As long as this terminological confusion is not entirely wiped out, there cannot be any question of stopping inflation.By obscuring the fact that price inflation (a general rise in all prices) is the result of monetary inflation, government and central bank officials can blame inflation on all kinds of things. After all, there are a lot of reasons certain prices go up and certain prices go down.
For example, spiking oil prices after the invasion of Ukraine werent technically inflation. It would be better described as a price shock. Price shocks do, in fact, raise prices. And those price increases can cascade through the economy, causing other prices to rise with them.
But unlike price increases due to monetary inflation, decreases in other areas of the economy will generally balance out price shocks (absent inflation) as people shift spending patterns.
If people have to pay more for gasoline, they may cancel vacation plans or quit eating out. This drop in demand will cause hotel and restaurant prices to fall even as fuel prices rise.
In contrast, theres only one thing that will cause a
general
rise in prices with no corresponding price decreases - an increase in the money supply - what we used to define as inflation.
Milton Friedman summed it up.
[Inflation] is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. Its always and everywhere a result of too much money.
But thanks to the change in definition, there is no word for the thing that causes price inflation  money printing. Instead, were told corporate greed, or Putins price hikes, or consumer expectations, or a strong economy are causing prices to rise.
If we use the traditional definition of inflation, the culprit becomes clear.
Who expands the money supply?
The Fed and the federal government.
When you accurately define inflation, you know exactly who to blame. But if the people responsible for your pain can fool you into believing that the symptom of inflation
is
inflation, they get to wiggle off the hook."
Investing.com,The Demise of Price Inflation Seems Somewhat Exaggerated,2024-01-11,0.555556,"By Mike Maharrey,
Money Metals Exchange
No matter what you read about the December Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, you should keep one important fact top of mind: every number is far above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target.
Given that fact, it would seem the death of price inflation seems somewhat exaggerated.
The headline CPI for December came out hotter than expected. Prices rose 0.3 percent month-on-month, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The expectation was for a 0.2 percent increase.
That pushed that annual CPI up to 3.4 percent from 3.1 percent in November.
Stripping out more volatile food and energy prices, core CPI rose by 0.3 percent. That equaled the 0.3 percent increase in November but was in line with estimates. The annual core CPI came in at 3.9 percent, down a tick from 4 percent the prior month.
It's worth noting that core CPI has been hovering in the 4 percent range since July and remains nearly double the Fed's 2 percent target.
To put the monthly core CPI increase in perspective, it would need to average just under 0.17 percent per month to hit the 2 percent annual target.
Keep in mind, inflation is worse than the government data suggest. The government revised the CPI formula in the 1990s so that it understates the actual rise in prices. Based on the formula used in the 1970s, CPI is closer to double the official numbers.
Digging more deeply into the numbers, rising shelter costs drove the overall CPI higher last month. Shelter prices rose 0.5 percent month-on-month and 6.2 percent on an annual basis.
Energy prices also reversed in December, charting a 0.4 gain after sliding 2.3 percent in November.
Food prices continue to creep up month after month. The food index rose 0.2 percent month-on-month, matching the November increase. On an annual basis, food prices rose 3.4 percent (not seasonally adjusted).The higher-than-expected headline CPI dampened hope for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, although many market analysts tried to spin the CPI report as ""not that bad.""
Capital Economics chief North American economist Paul Ashworth told
MarketWatch
that the December CPI report doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of a rate cut as early as March. He said two big drivers of the CPI increase - used cars and shelter - will likely reverse in the coming months.In short, we dont think Decembers CPI data necessarily rules out a March rate cut by the Fed.
Principal Asset Management chief global strategist Seema Shah was less sanguine.
Todays inflation report reinforces the notion that the market had gotten a little overexcited around the timing of rate cuts. These are not bad numbers, but they do show that disinflation progress is still slow and unlikely to be a straight line down to 2 percent.
But she still penciled in rate cuts as early as mid-2024.
This optimism despite the actual CPI data underscores the fact that the markets are desperate for rate cuts because most people recognize that the debt-riddled economy can't function long-term with interest rates at this level.
We're already seeing signs of strain. There were more corporate bankruptcies in 2023 than there were during the pandemic year of 2020.It's important to recognize the mainstream wants the Fed to claim victory over inflation so it can go back to inflationary policies. In effect, an end to rate increases, subsequent rate cuts, and loosening monetary policy will eventually lead to more price inflation.
In other words, as soon as the Fed declares victory, inflation wins.
How?
Because rising prices are a symptom of monetary inflation. And monetary inflation is exactly what we will get when the central bank reverts to a looser monetary policy.
In fact, despite the rate hikes, the Fed hasnt been nearly as aggressive in tightening monetary policy as you might think. From a historical perspective, financial conditions remain loose.
The Chicago Fed Financial Conditions Index confirms this. The NFCI ticked down to 0.51 in the week ending Jan. 5. A negative number indicates loose conditions.
Despite the fact rate hikes have cooled CPI in recent months, the Fed is still a long way from victory. And yet the mainstream remains convinced victory is imminent. The fact is, victory isn't even in the cards. It's more like surrender."
Investing.com,US CPI Preview,2024-02-13,0.333333,"The January US CPI report will be released at

Instead of following that script, weve seen blowout employment figures, inflation seemingly reaccelerating, and the Fed pushing back on expectations for interest rate cuts in March. Tomorrows US CPI report is the next big test to see if the nascent trend of US economic exceptionalism in 2024 continues.Digging into the data, headline CPI has clearly seen its decline stall over the last couple of quarters, with the year-over-year measure actually increasing from 3.0% to 3.4% over the last six months. That said, the Fed is more concerned with the Core CPI reading, which is seen as more indicative of underlying price pressures and has continued to edge lower in recent months.One of the best leading indicators for inflation is the Prices component of the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI surveys. Historically, a simple average of these two components has been a relatively reliable predictor of CPI readings 3-6 months into the future, as the chart below shows:Source: TradingView, StoneXWhile it wont necessarily impact CPI dramatically this month, the most recent round of PMI surveys showed prices increasing for 58.5% of respondents across the two surveys, suggesting that inflation could well tick up as we move into the Spring. This is no doubt a concern for the Fed and may lead to a smaller-than-expected reaction even if this weeks (lagging) CPI reading comes in below expectations.Notably,
traders are not necessarily expecting a massive move on the back of this months CPI report

If bulls are able to overcome that resistance level (potentially on the back of a hotter-than-expected US CPI report), the pair has little in the way of technical resistance until closer to 152.00.

That was generally the 2013 to 2019 era generally attended by a strong US dollar.To this day, the dogs devour every morsel thrown their way and their confidence in our monetary regulators is intact, by definition. Every time a still-hot economic or inflation signal comes in the market quakes in its boots, and that includes the anti-bubble, gold. Confidence = intact. Gold is for when intact becomes unglued.Hence, the only thing a right-minded market participant can do (excluding the vast majority who still think its normal as their financial advisers continue to cost average up into nosebleed territory) is not short it in a committed fashion, play it from the long side with risk management or sit and collect the cash income that the Fed is paying you to take advantage of.As for speculating from the long side, what has been working best over the last year is what we originally projected a year ago, the Goldilocks stuff, as a market in full submission to the Feds every utterance from its various orifices continues to view cost-push inflation implied in the January Payrolls report and even a slight uptick in Manufacturing (well take a brief look at the latest ISM in this weekends NFTRH report) with fear of the Fed, which in turn has been driving the US dollar.So confidence is intact, by definition. Markets are flat-out bullish. AI is going to make us all rich (well, I sold SMCI too soon, collecting
only
a +/- 70% profit on two separate trades). Actually, I had to sell SMCI just as I had to sell ANET before it because my DNA directs me not to be a hype follower and by extension, anything resembling a committed bubble player.This graph produced by John Hussman was taken from a more extensive article, which you may want to check out. Feel free to reference the NFTRH Links page any time, as youll find Doc Hussman and many other worthwhile sources there (market tools, economic data, industry news/analysis, biased and unbiased analysis alike, and so much more). Ive built that links page for my own reference. Why not bookmark it for yourself?Here Hussman illustrates in one picture that our bullish markets and strong economy are the products of leverage. In an ongoing bubble this does not matter. In a bursting bubble? Well, it matters.So the above is a bullish picture at high risk because it is the product of leverage to a growing debt pile and by extension, deficits. That is what the economy and associated bull market are built upon. Play it if you will, but also understand it for what it is.For those submitting to the Feds every utterance (not to mention to their mainstream financial advisers assurances that they are professionally managing their wealth in the ways of tradition), its all good as long as the bubble in policy and associated markets and thus,
confidence
are intact.Other indicators we use in NFTRH show what we have been noting for months; that the market is two things 1) bullish and 2) at high risk. To save room for a more pointed discussion about individual equities and strategy in the upcoming
NFTRH 796
, Ill drop a cavalcade of our indicators in this public article for subscribers and the public alike to review.Again, I want to remind you that the Goldilocks link above is from a year ago when nobody else was talking Goldilocks and a relative few were talking bullish in general. I point that out because when I write highly negative articles like I perceive this one to be, proven credibility (that Ive not been a perma-bear, perma-bug, or perma anything else to this point) is important. I simply have to write about what I see and I dont care whose agenda it may or may not serve.On that note, risk is play in the form of sentiment and in the form of other indicators like the extreme low in the defensive Healthcare sector to the broad
SPX
. The
XLV
/SPY ratio has historically and reliably spiked upward into and during bear markets and hard corrections. The exception was 2012  2016 when there was a lot of healthcare-related political noise in the picture. The ratio shows
high risk to equities and yet a still bullish situation
.Speaking of a still bullish situation, the
Semiconductor > Tech > Broad
leadership chain has been a staple in NFTRH, keeping us from attempting an active bearish orientation and/or keeping us with a bullish view (risk and all).
SOX
leading
NDX
and NDX leading SPX is the bullish leadership recipe. Its intact, if not yet fully baked.As for gold, it is not yet signaling either a bear market or an illegitimate * bull market for stocks. During the un-shaded period from 2002 to 2011 the stock market spent the majority of the time in an apparent bull market. Stocks were going up! Gold went up better. Currently, SPX/Gold shows stock bulls sleeping soundly.* Well, thats debatable considering the majority of charts in this article.
But work with me here.However, the
Copper
/Gold ratio shows that aside from the strong dollar/Goldilocks stuff, a down economic cycle and stock market bear are just itching to come into play. Post-election, perhaps? Can they hold it together that long?
NFTRH 795
put on its tin foil hat last weekend and took a hard look at that question, both pros and cons.Meanwhile, another risk indicator to a still bullish market situation is the current state of the
VIX
vs. the bulling SPX. Its not a major thing, visually. But historically the VIX has tended to travel at least flat with a positive bias prior to SPX corrections. Today? Well, VIX is traveling with a positive bias in defiance of the big bull move in SPX.We anticipated, if not predicted a bull move in SPX, after all. Here is a chart Ive shown publicly on several occasions as 2023 went about its business of building a higher-risk situation with the desired ingredient to make a truly high-risk situation a higher high in SPX. The anticipation was for anything from a slightly higher high double top to an upside suck em in FOMO extravaganza and upside blow-off. The market is agitating for the latter now.With respect to the above, ironically the recent bump up in Fed hawkishness could sustain the bull longer than if they had remained stapled to the March rate cut view. Its when the Fed is finally compelled to start cutting to get in line with the declining
2-year yield
that max bear damage has been inflicted. I dont say so. The chart and history say so.There are many more indicators we use. From Libor Yields to High Yield Spreads to yield curves and more that are currently telling us theGold, not mentioned much in this article, nonetheless lays in wait for the post-bubble *. Ill continue to respect the idea that a major post-bubble indicator kicked in in 2022. That would be in the in the form of the king of NFTRH indicators, the Continuum, which after years of keeping us aware that inflationary policymakers were in full control (the Continuum indicated pleasant disinflation, after all) smashed its limiting moving averages. And you wonder why todays Fed is so zealous about fighting inflation?* Post-bubble will be the only macro that will sustain an extended and potentially epic move in the gold mining industry because by then the gold mining products relationship to cyclical and risk on asset markets will leverage the miners bottom lines to the upside. This is the Bob Hoye playbook, but its been elusive over the bubble years (decades) and its still not quite time yet."
Investing.com,"Stocks, Rates Stall at Key Resistances",2024-02-09,0.666667,"So, it was another rather boring day, with the
S&P 500
finishing flat, rates up, the
dollar
up, and implied volatility somewhat higher. This has been a very odd earnings season.Last night, I noted a rising wedge in the S&P 500, and as of yesterdays close, the index is pretty much out of room.There might be a little bit more time it could buy, but not much. As I mentioned yesterday, these patterns are bearish by definition.However, just because something is bearish doesnt mean it has to break lower.Normally, I would have much more confidence in this pattern, but given how difficult the last four months have been for my S&P 500 views, I am quite hesitant about it.If the pattern breaks lower, then it could retrace back to its origin at 4850. Where it goes from there, I would have to see.If it reaches 4,850, a lot can start to happen because I have numerous trend lines converging in that region. If these trend lines begin to break, things could start to happen.I noted earlier that implied volatility somewhat increased yesterday, and thats because the
VIX
was essentially flat, but the VVIX rose by 3% to 83, marking an increase for two consecutive days.Sometimes, when the VVIX starts to rise, the VIX isnt too far behind.The VVIX measures the implied volatility of the VIX, and when the implied volatility of the VIX starts to rise, it suggests to me that something is happening beneath the surface to cause this.Part of the reason why we see the VIX remain below 13 to 14 is due to the significant gamma buildup around the options expiration next Wednesday, yes, February 14th.Its unusual to see the VIX options expiration (OPEX) occur on the second Wednesday of the month, but thats what the calendar indicates.I bring this up because its interesting to observe implied volatility levels rising from beneath, while options flows are helping to keep the VIX contained.Meanwhile, the
30-year bond
auction yesterday went fine, yet we still saw the 30-year and the
10-year
rates move higher.The 10-year is very close to breaking out and rising above the 4.20% region. If that happens, I think we could see it rise to around 4.35% to start with.Im also keeping an eye on the
Mexican Peso
, of all things, because it looks like a double bottom is in the process of forming, mixed in with a diamond reversal pattern.Theres solid momentum forming on the RSI, which has been pushing higher since June.When you invert the peso, it becomes easier to see the relationship between the Peso and the S&P 500.These relationships between the S&P 500 and currencies seem to exist widely and are a function of the dollar's weakening and strengthening.This emphasizes how much of the market movements have to do with changes in financial conditions. It is also evident that the S&P 500 and the peso are diverging.Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) is also diverging from the S&P 500 and appears to be in a more bearish formation than the S&P 500. A close below $186 likely sets up a drop back to around $167.It almost looks like Tesla (NASDAQ:
TSLA
) has broken the neckline of a head and shoulders pattern.Its not clear at this point, but I can easily get the impression that if this is indeed the confirmation of the pattern, then the losses in the stock arent over yet.Nvidia (NASDAQ:
NVDA
) exhibited a notable reversal candle yesterday, after moving above yesterdays high and then closing below yesterdays close.However, given how overbought it is, and the fact that the call wall for the stock for this week and next week is at $700, theres probably a good reason why the stock has struggled in this region over the last four days.AnywayYouTube Video Original Post"
Investing.com,S&P 500,2024-02-08,0.666667,"I must say that writing these days is a real challenge, and yesterday was one of those days, mostly because it was just more of the same with the troubling three continuing to lead the charge.There is just nothing else to say there.Is it a rising wedge that is forming in the
S&P 500
? It looks like one. Does it mean anything? Not sure.The definition of a rising wedge is a bearish pattern that begins wide at the bottom and contracts as it moves higher. So, it fits that definition.On top of that, we have divergences all over the place, most notably in the
dollar
. It has certainly been the case when looking at the inverse of the
Swiss Franc
.The inverse of the 1-month implied correlation index is also going in the opposite direction of the S&P 500.Meanwhile, there has been a divergence between the S&P 500 and
HYG
junk bond ETF.There used to be a time when reserve balances even mattered, and to this point, those have stopped going higher as well.Financial conditions have even stopped easing.Even the number of stocks above their 50-day moving average has been diverging.So, unless the equity market has figured out a way to decouple itself from rates, the dollar, financial conditions, and everything else, the insanity of the last four months should be about over. I have nothing left to add.YouTube Video Original Post"
Investing.com,S&P 500 E-Mini to Test All-Time Highs?,2024-02-05,0.555556,"The monthly chart is forming an
S&P 500 Emini
test all-time high. The bulls hope that the market will reach the all-time high and break out above. The bears want a reversal from a lower high major trend reversal or a double top and a large wedge pattern (Dec 2, July 27, and Feb 2) forming at the trend channel line area."
Investing.com,NFP Preview,2024-02-02,0.666667,"Stocks rebounded yesterday ahead of todays job report, with
expectations
for 185,000 new jobs to have been created, down from 216,000 last month.Meanwhile, the
unemployment rate
is expected to tick higher to around 3.8% from 3.7% last month, while
wage growth
is expected to drop to 0.3% in January from 0.4% in December and
stay steady
at 4.1% y/y.Remember, last year, we got that shock January job report that was much better than expected.We saw the
S&P 500
rebound yesterday and managed to stall at 4900; it was the spot where the index opened yesterday.Given the results from Meta (NASDAQ:
META
) and its big move higher, it seems we could fill that gap today, as long as the jobs report comes in ok and has no surprises.I remained focused on the Implied Volatility levels for the Mag7 names and the S&P 500 and see how this plays out.Im not sure how the movement in Meta will play into this because the shares are up a lot after it announced a dividend and added on its share buyback program.Meta released results that were much better than expected, which I would call shock-and-awe on the revenue beat and even the guidance for revenue next quarter.The new dividend was a surprise, so the stock is up 14% after hours. Some of this may have been done to overshadow the higher capex and higher-than-expected expenses.The company sees a capex of $30 to $37 billion in 2024 versus estimates of $33.4 billion.The company also sees total expenses at $94 to $99 billion versus estimates of $96.4 billion. The move up seems like a lot to me, so it will be interesting to see if all the gains hold.Amazon (NASDAQ:
AMZN
) is trading up 7.5% after hours, which also seems like a lot, considering AWS missed revenue estimates, coming in at $24.204 billion versus estimates of $24.221 billion.This is fractionally, but considering the size of the beat by Azure, the AWS numbers do not seem to compare as well.The company also guided first-quarter revenue of $138 to $143.5 billion versus estimates of $142 billion.It is just surprising I guess to have seen Microsoft (NASDAQ:
MSFT
) go down after it was reported and to see these Amazon AWS numbers for Amazon to go up.I get that operating income was better, but still. I own both Microsoft and Amazon.Of course, Apple (NASDAQ:
AAPL
) reported good numbers on the top and bottom but had horrible numbers out of China, which was a big concern of mine.The company reported China revenue of $20.8 billion versus estimates of $23.5 billion and an 11.4% miss. Services revenue for Apple also missed coming in at $23.1 billion versus estimates of $23.3. billion.Apple does give numbers for guidance, but said it expected revenue to be flat to last year for the fiscal second quarter, versus expectation for 1% growth. The stock is down about 3.5% after hours.So overall, it was just a strange day, and I could imagine today getting stranger with the job report still out there.Original Post"
Investing.com,"US Dollar, Gold Relationship With Silver Could Indicate Next Market Direction",2024-02-02,0.666667,"As FOMC rides into the sunset until March, the
US Dollar Index
is left to fend for itself amid the hawkish (or at least not yet dovish) echos of Jerome Powells assertion that the market should not expect rate cuts in March. Well duh, we know that already, sir.The only benefit the
US dollar
would be left with, assuming the not yet dovish policy does not turn hawkish again, would be the potential for a counter-party bid.An impulsive bid by risk-soaked casino patrons suddenly jerking to a safe haven. Which USD surely is, much like
gold
. The difference being that
USD is a safe haven tool
as long as public confidence in debt paper remains.
Gold is a safe value haven
, long-term.As a tool and with the herds confidence implied to be intact, by virtue of its global reserve status USD receives incoming (forced) investment when herds flee the asset racket, which has been set up counter the US dollar by decades of US and global inflationary monetary policy.Yet here we find a recent disconnect between stocks (
S&P 500
and global, ex-US) and inverse USD. Either USD is going to drop (inverse rise back in line with stocks) or just maybe we might have the start of something important in the form of a fundamental change of character in the macro markets.That could mean market rotation, a stock bear market (SPX has finally joined the new all-time highs! contingent, after all, a preferred ingredient to making a sentiment-fueled top) or, if USD continues to bounce (inverse continues to drop) even a slippery slope into a market liquidation (again, reference all that soft landing, no landing Goldilocks consensus out there in the mainstream financial media for a potential contrary setup).The Gold/Silver ratio (GSR) is still perched constructively to attend USD upward, after all. If gold were to rise impulsively vs. silver the inflation trades would be off and the market liquidation trades could be on.Silver
is less monetary, more speculative, and more cyclical/inflation-sensitive than gold. If the GSR breaks down from this constructive perch, the inflation trades would benefit.Moving on, lets take a brief look at the technical status of the anti-market, the US dollar index (DXY). Much like the bull trap from September to November felt like it took forever and a day to resolve, todays meeting with resistance is a persistent little bugger.Grinding, chewing, and instigating to take out resistance at 103.50. As advised to my subscribers several weeks ago, the key level to exceed and hold (for USD to go bullish) is the December high at 104.27. But first USD is buzz-sawing the resistance area and the important daily SMA 200.The weekly chart provides the perspective that a level of caution, for inflation traders, is provided by the fact that the index held a higher low to the bear trap low with the bounce starting from clear long-term support.If the US dollar index fails to make a higher high to the December high and instead turns down (and silver leads gold upward), then the broad rally can continue, especially in the more traditional inflation trades like commodities and equities that produce commodities/resources, and resource-rich regions within Emerging Markets.If the US dollar index takes out the December high and holds it, and the Gold/Silver ratio follows its current constructive pattern upward, you might want to do a thorough check of the investment pool. The might be a turd in there!To add a third dynamic, there was a blessed phase from 2001 to 2004 when the Gold/Silver ratio rose (non-impulsively), the US dollar declined and the gold mining sector had its most fundamentally pure macro backdrop for years previous and now 20 years since. After that commodities and stock markets rallied as well and the gold miners entered a bubble amid degrading fundamentals. But even a 2 to 3-year phase would be quite profitable."
Investing.com,"Lets Talk Inflation, Post-CPI",2024-02-14,0.333333,"A vast majority of people see inflation as rising prices, wages, and pushed costs within the economy. In other words.Today, we are all, to varying degrees, taking bites out of the Feds excrement.The headlines blare on about CPI, but the inflation problem was created by rapid increases in the money supply. That was the mechanics of inflations
creation
, with too many newly printed currency units seeking out a finite number of assets. That is inflation. Not todays cost effects headlines. This of course is the legacy of our dear monetary leaders, over-schooled in Keynesian theories and eggheads all.Here is the continuum of the Feds legacy, a steadily increasing (M2) money supply that not coincidentally apes the perma-increasing CPI over the long-term; themost recent report for whichis causing Tuesdays market uproar amid intact confidence in (and/or submission to) the great and powerful Fed of Oz.See the little hook upward in M2 of late? Well, consider this input, which was sent to me byNFTRHsubscriber and Austrian monetary expert Michael Pollaro back in January:Gee, do you think that maybe there is an election year political angle in play?Aside from the hype of the day, the trend continues to be disinflationary, benefiting the Biden administration currently in power with its Goldilocks overtones, while behind the curtain the wizard regulates and adjusts his knobs and levers to try to steer the Good Ship Lollipop through a tricky maze of rocks just beneath the surface.As a side note, the Fed is on the surface apolitical, as the same Fed chief oversaw the
creation
of the inflationary bailout under Trump. Its actions have tended to benefit power, regardless of affiliation.Here is the MoM view of the CPI situation. To see what a liquidity crisis looks like, cast your eyes upon the 2020 situation. That was the trigger that sprang the Fed into (inflationary) action. Period. We called it  and the forthcoming inflation trades  back then in real time and sure enough, inflationary effects, so despised and fretted over to this day, also manifested out of that inflationary action.What action, you ask? Well, the action of M2s panicked percentage change from the previous year. Thats what action.So here we are with the culprits being all the stuff lagging within the economy long after the great and powerful Fed of Oz has apparently (but maybe not really) shifted its focus to inflation fighting. Personally, I have lucked out! I no longer need haircuts because I shave my faulty head of hair myself. Also, I got rid of my garbage contractor because they were such a pain in the ass, service wise, that going to the dump once a week is much easier (and way cheaper). Im on easy street, I tell you!All joking aside, this (January CPI components) is the stuff of lag. This is the dreck that clings to the economy years after the Fed rode to the rescue of asset owners by inflating the money supply in epic and historic fashion in 2020.I am not going to sermonize, lecture or screed on. You likely already know the deal if you stay away from mainstream (academic, political and otherwise) brainwashing and simply view the indications of the truth. Its an election year. Much noise will emanate out of the medias orifice just as the Fed is discharging contradictory noises out of its orifice.Central banks (with a big assist from governments fiscal actions) created the post-2020 inflation problem. Period. Now as the Fed tries to clean up its huge share of it, not all is as it appears. Not in the headlines and not in the machinations behind the curtain. That goes for government too, obviously."

Fed Monitor Tool
, while the odds for May stand at about 30%, which is down from over 90% a few weeks ago.Looking out to June, traders believe there is a 75% chance rates will be lower by the end of that meeting.The U.S. consumer price index rose
0.3%
last month after gaining 0.2% in December. In the 12 months through January, the annual CPI increased
3.1%
.That followed a 3.4% advance in December. Economists polled by Investing.com had been looking for a monthly increase of 0.2% and an annual gain of 2.9%.As seen in the chart below, U.S. CPI inflation has come down significantly since the summer of 2022, when it peaked at a 40-year high of 9.1%.Source: Investing.comNonetheless, while the rate of inflation is trending lower, prices are still rising far more quickly than what the Fed would consider consistent with its 2% target range.Excluding the volatile food and energy components, core CPI increased
0.4%
in January after climbing 0.3% in the previous month. On an annual basis, core CPI rose
3.9%
, matching December's increase.Source: Investing.comThe forecast had been for 0.3% and 3.7%, respectively.In a worrying sign, the so-called supercore inflation measure, which tracks the cost of services minus housing and energy, jumped 0.8% on the month, the most since April 2022.Source: ZeroHedgeThe supercore figure is closely watched by Fed officials who believe that it provides a more accurate assessment of the future direction of inflation.Overall, these numbers suggest that the Feds inflation battle is far from over and that policymakers would need to see further progress on sticky underlying core measures before they are comfortable cutting interest rates.Furthermore, any additional reacceleration in consumer prices could risk reigniting talks that the FOMC might even deliver another rate hike after pausing its tightening cycle last year.The Fed recently held its policy rate in the
5.25% to 5.50%
range, where it has been since July 2023.As such, the central bank is likely to keep policy rates higher for longer than markets currently expect as inflation stays elevated, and the economy continues to grow at a solid pace amid a resilient labor market and robust consumer spending.Investors should brace for fresh turmoil in the coming weeks as cracks begin to widen in the early-year rally on Wall Street and the stock market faces a growing risk of a near-term pullback.Looking back on the fourth quarter and the recent rally in stocks, a lot of it was driven by hope and speculation of an imminent Fed rate cut, however, that no longer appears to be the base case with the Fed pivot evaporating before our eyes.As such, I have rebalanced my portfolio of individual stocks and ETFs to reflect a mostly bearish position as I believe Tuesdays negative price action is an inflection point for a more sustained move lower in equities.At the time of writing, I have a short position on the

Investing.com,"Gold Drops Below 2,000, EUR/USD Drops to 3-Month Low on US Inflation Data Release",2024-02-14,0.333333,"The
US Dollar Index
(DXY) rallied sharply and reached a 3-month high on Tuesday, while the gold price plunged.The price of gold fell below the crucial level of 2,000 for the first time since the beginning of 2024 after the US inflation report showed increasing Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, reducing hopes for an early interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed). 'That was not the report that the market wanted to see. Surprisingly stubborn inflation has dropped the chances of a May rate cut to under 50% for the moment,' said Tai Wong, the New York-based independent metals analyst. Indeed, the latest inflation figures make it more likely that Fed policymakers won't reduce interest rates until June. High-interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding gold. Therefore, if interest rates remain high,
XAU/USD
will face downward pressure.XAU/USD was essentially unchanged during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, no major events on the economic calendar could potentially reverse or extend the new bearish trend in XAU/USD. Traders will be waiting to see how the US Retail Sales report on Thursday and the Producer Price Index report on Friday may shape interest rate expectations. Currently, the technical bias remains bearish as gold trades below the pivotal 2,000 mark.The euro (EUR) lost almost 0.6% on Tuesday after the US data showed that inflation rose more than expected in January. The report fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will hold interest rates steady in March and May.Yesterday's data showed that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% month-on-month in January, above the 0.2% increase expected by economists polled by Reuters. Likewise, the increase in the core CPI was higher than expected, immediately reducing the probability of an imminent interest rate cut by the Fed. Currently, the market has completely priced out the chance of a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut in March, considering only a 37% chance of a 25 bps cut in May.The key message from today's CPI is that it's slowing but less than expected. The reading supports the Fed's decision to continue to wait for more assurance that inflation is well contained,' said Dec Mullarkey, the managing director at SLC Management. Investors' long-term interest rate expectations have also shifted. According to the interest rate swap market data, traders expect only 90 bps worth of rate cuts by the Fed and almost 110 bps worth of rate cuts by the European Central Bank in 2024. As a result, the divergence in monetary policy expectations exerts downward pressure on
EUR/USD
.EUR/USD was attempting to recover during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders will probably continue to digest yesterday's data, so the established bearish trend might continue. Additional volatility may be triggered by the release of eurozone Gross Domestic Product figures at 10:00 a.m. UTC. If the numbers are lower than expected, the decline in EUR/USD might deepen, pushing the pair below 1.07000. Otherwise, the pair may rebound, targeting the 1.07600 area.The Australian dollar (AUD) plunged by 1.8% on Tuesday as the US Dollar Index (DXY) surged to a 3-month high on a higher-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.Tuesday's US inflation report surprised the market, significantly shifting investors' expectations for the US interest rate path. The Australian dollar, being a highly risk-sensitive currency, suffered the most among the major currencies. The market no longer expects the Federal Reserve (Fed) to deliver a rate cut this spring. Instead, investors are pricing in a near 50% probability of a 25 basis point (bps) rate reduction in June. Still, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) seems even less dovish than the Fed. According to interest rate swap market data, the market expects only 24 bps worth of rate cuts by the RBA in 2024. Thus, the sell-off in
AUD/USD
appears overextended as the divergence in monetary policy expectations between the Fed and RBA favours the AUD.AUD/USD rose strongly during the Asian and early European sessions but remained below the important 0.65000 level. Today, the economic calendar is uneventful for AUD/USD, so the pair may stay under bearish pressure as long as it moves below 0.65000. However, the release of the Australian Labour Force Survey at 12:30 a.m. UTC tomorrow may stoke extra volatility in AUD pairs. 'The RBA will be hoping to see some softness in the Australian employment data tomorrow, given that a tight labour market remains a source of inflationary pressure,' said Tim Waterer, the chief market analyst at KCM Trade. If the labour report is weaker than expected, AUD/USD will probably continue to decline, but 0.64400 will offer strong support. Conversely, higher-than-expected employment figures may push the pair above 0.65000."
Investing.com,CPI Fallout,2024-02-14,0.666667,"This is the reason that serious people dont choose a trend length that happens to fit with their narrative.For the last few months, supposedly serious economists have crowed about how the 3-month average of seasonally-adjusted
CPI
was at a new post-COVID low.(Most of those same economists, only a few months ago, were focused on the 6-month average, but when that started crawling higher they switched to the 3-month average.)And indeed, it was exciting. Headline CPI was down to 1.89% on a seasonally adjusted three-month average;
core CPI
was at 3.30%.Victory over inflation was proclaimed! Inflation was back at target, even a bit below, so the Fed should start easing policy forthwith.Fortunately, and maybe surprisingly, Chairman Powell is built of stronger stuff.As a Cliffs Notes guide to what youre going to read: all of those folks who loved the 3-month average when it was 1.89%, arent going to be as vocal about it now that its at 2.80%.Core, on a 3-month average basis, is at 3.92%. The 6-month averages also rose.Now, this doesnt mean that inflation is necessarily headed back higher yet. Ill get to that in a bit, but I will allow how the picture of
m/m core
CPI, below, might be perceived by some as discouraging.Before this figure, the consensus was for a fairly strong report, 0.16% on headline and 0.28% on core. I thought it would be
softer
because rents based on my model should start to decelerate soon.But, as I said in my podcast, if rents were high then you should look past rents. Theyre going to decelerate over the next 6 months or so, to around 3% y/y, and then re-accelerate.Thats all baked in the cake, and it will flatter the inflation data. But it hasnt happened yet! OER was a massive +0.56% m/m.Primary Rents were more in line with what I was looking for, with a small deceleration to +0.36% m/m from +0.39% last month.The indices are still decelerating just not as rapidly as I think anyone (myself included now!) expected.Lodging Away from Home was +1.78%, which was a big m/m figure and contributed to the overall housing subindex being +0.62% m/m at a time when shelter
should
be decelerating.But as I said, if this surprise was all OER then we can look past it.Core Goods was weak, which was a downside surprise. Used Cars fell -3.37% m/m, which is far worse than any surveys saw this month.But as I pointed out last month, Used Cars had been surprisingly
strong
compared to the private surveys so this is partly a make-up and it contributed to the weakness in Core Goods.Medicinal Drugs were also weak, -0.54% m/m and thats also in Core Goods. Overall, Core Goods  which had shown some signs of life  dropped back to deflation y/y this month.Going forward, I dont think core goods will stay in deflation.Partly, thats because supply chains are being stressed again due to drought in the Panama Canal and the effective shutting of the Red Sea to container traffic, but its also partly because there is continued interest in nearshoring which will raise costs (after all, it was to
lower
costs that firms offshored stuff in the first place.And then theres also this, for the medium term. To be sure, this level of growth in Personal Consumption in the past was consistent with mild deflation  but that was pre-nearshoring.The direction is what Im interested in, but I also think that for a given amount of
PCE
growth, we will see more core goods inflation in the future.So now we turn to the really interesting part of the report, and thats core services ex-shelter. Ive been saying for a while that this category was going to be a sticky wicket because wages are still rising at a 5% y/y pace.And indeed, the wicket is sticky. This month, airfares rose +1.4% (this may have been related to jet fuel tightness on the East Coast), but also again we saw a continued acceleration to Hospital Services, which rose to the highest y/y rate (+6.7%) since 2011.Overall, core services ex-shelter (so-called Supercore) rose +0.85% m/m, the biggest rise in a couple of years, and the y/y measure is in an upswing.Overall, this report is deflating pun absolutely, 100% intended for those who thought that inflation is settling gently back to target and that the Fed therefore can lower interest rates back to where we have a God-Given Right to have them, 2% or so.Not so fast! Median, by the way, was also a scintillating +0.53% m/m, the highest since last February. Thanks to base effects, the y/y Median CPI was essentially flat, at 4.90% y/y.Because of the deceleration in housing, I expect, I continue to see the Median slowing to the high-3s, and low-4s over the middle of this year.But it is going to have a hard time getting lower than that. In the short-term, we have a saucy performance from core services ex-shelter.In the short- and medium-term, core goods are going to get out of deflation (although I dont expect it to
rise
very far).And then housing should re-accelerate, though not back to the old highs. In short, inflation is a long way from being beaten.I am sure that somehow, thats bullish for stocks, but I cant figure out why. (I hear the 3-month moving average of the last four months of CPI, dropping the highest month, looks good.)"
Investing.com,Inflation Jitters Hits Wall Street; Fed Rate Cut Timeline Pushed Back,2024-02-14,0.333333,"Uh oh! Yesterdays inflation data from the US didnt go smoothly down the markets throat. Instead, the stronger-than-expected set of inflation data dashed hopes of seeing the Federal Reserve (Fed) cut rates anytime in the first half of this year.The
US 2-year yield
jumped past 4.60% and returned to the levels before the Feds pivot hint in December  when they had revealed a dot plot predicting 75bp cut this year. The
US 10-year
is back to 4.30%. There is no way the Fed cuts its rates in March. The probability of a May rate cut tanked from 56% to around 40% in a single session. Markets now see the first Fed cut happen in June, with around 75% chance. Thats such a wild ride in market expectations; we began this year pricing 80% chance for a March rate cut, and we came all the way to pricing a 75% chance for a June rate cut.No wonder, equities are not happy. The
S&P 500
fell 1.37% yesterday from an ATH and Nasdaq dived 1.58%. Small caps, which are more sensitive to financing costs, tanked almost 4%. Although some insist that the data could be just a blip in the US disinflation trend and should not get everyone panicked and selling, the overbought market conditions which resulted from overstretched rate cut expectations should find a more balanced place to sit. It would only be healthy for the S&P 500 and
Nasdaq
to consolidate and give back some of the latest advance. Otherwise, the valuations become excessive and unsustainable, anyway.Regarding the rate cuts, no one can tell you if June or July would be a better time for the Fed to start cutting. The data will decide when the time comes. Yet the incoming data shows a surprising strength in the US economy.
Atlanta Feds GDP estimate, for example, prints a 3.4% growth for Q1  far from a number that would push the Fed to start cutting rates. As such, the blip in yesterdays disinflation is more understandable than not given how strongly the US consumers spend.The
US Dollar Index
rallied past its 100-DMA and tested the 105 level on the back of exhausted Fed doves.
Gold
slipped below $2000 per ounce on the back of a stronger
dollar
and rising yields  that increase the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest-bearing gold. The
EUR/USD
tested 1.07 to the downside, and the
USD/JPY
rallied past the 150 level. All eyes are now shifting to the Japanese officials who could  anytime  intervene in the FX markets to cool down the selling pressure on the yen.For those who didnt have enough of inflation news, British inflation didnt rise as expected in January despite a stronger-than-expected jobs data released yesterday. Cable remains under pressure due to a softer-than-expected CPI read and a broadly stronger dollar, but the selloff in
EUR/GBP
has potential to extend toward the 0.84 level in the continuation of an ABCD bearish pattern.And finally, inflation in Switzerland got every single central banker envious as consumer prices in Switzerland rose only 1.3% in January on a yearly basis, down from 1.7% printed a month earlier. The super strong franc helped the Swiss keep their head above water this January  and even climb on a yacht! On a side note, I should admit that economists that put this number together have a better strategy for managing their health insurance costs (that went up by 10% this January on average) than I do, or the weight of insurance costs in the consumer basket doesnt match the reality. But the good news is, the below-target inflation should encourage the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to cut rates before the others, soften the
franc
, boost the Swiss economy & exports, and help the
SMI index
return to the top half of its 2022-to-now trading range. But the bad news is, appetite for SMI will still face a challenging blow to overall investor sentiment if things start getting ugly elsewhere."

Investing.com,Markets seek direction from US CPI report,2024-02-13,0.444444,
Investing.com,"How the CPI Report May Impact Gold, British Pound",2024-02-13,0.333333,"The gold (XAU) price declined by 0.22% on Monday in a relatively quiet trading session as traders refrained from placing big orders ahead of today's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.Jim Wyckoff, the senior analyst at Kitco Metal, said that interest rate cuts would probably be pushed back to the second half of the year, as US economic data has been too strong lately to expect a rate cut by May. He also added that there is limited buying interest in gold due to the recent rally in the stock market. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the chance of a 25 basis point (bps) interest rate cut in May is now less than 50%. High-interest rates exert bearish pressure on gold since the metal doesn't yield any passive income.XAU/USD
was essentially flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the most important event is the US CPI report at 1:30 p.m. UTC, which could offer insights into the Fed's plans for interest rates. A Reuters poll of economists projects a 0.2% monthly rise in January's CPI, while core figures are expected to increase by 0.3%. Figures exceeding these forecasts will almost certainly lower the probability of an interest rate cut this spring, potentially bringing XAU/USD below 2,000. Conversely, lower-than-expected CPI numbers will likely cause a rally in XAU/USD, possibly towards 2,050.The euro (EUR) lost 0.1% in a relatively volatile trading session on Monday, as the market participants repositioned ahead of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.EUR/USD
had been in an uptrend for the past week, but the bullish trend has recently weakened. Fundamentally, the eurozone economy appears weaker than the US, leading traders to price in more interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) than by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Thus, the fundamental pressure on EUR/USD should be bearish. However, the pair is highly sensitive to new data releases and officials' comments. For example, the decline in EUR/USD yesterday might have been partly due to dovish comments from ECB board member Piero Cipollone. He stated that the central bank doesn't need to create more slack in the eurozone economy to get inflation under control, given that demand is already weak. In other words, the ECB is increasingly seeking an opportunity to cut interest rates.EUR/USD was essentially flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions ahead of the US CPI report at 1:30 p.m. UTC. Lower-than-expected figures will increase the Fed's confidence in taking control over inflation. Thus, the data will likely lead to a sell-off in the
US dollar
, while EUR/USD might rally above 1.08000. If CPI figures exceed the forecast, EUR/USD can potentially drop below the important 1.07200 level.The British pound (GBP) gained 0.06% in a quiet trading session on Monday.GBP/USD
has been moving sideways for the past 4 days ahead of the release of the critical macroeconomic reports from the US and the U.K. This week is likely to be extremely volatile for GBP traders as inflation reports in both countries, together with other significant releases, will provide clues on when the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England (BOE) may begin cutting interest rates. Currently, the market views the BOE as a relatively less dovish regulator than the Fed. According to the interest rate swap market data, investors price in only 80 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts from the BOE but expect 110 bps worth of rate cuts from the Fed in 2024. This week's reports may substantially alter current expectations and define the GBP/USD trend in the medium term.GBP/USD was essentially unchanged in the Asian session today but jumped sharply during the early European trading hours following the release of a better-than-expected labor market report by the Office of National Statistics. The data showed that British wages, excluding bonuses, grew by 6.2% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, while the unemployment rate dropped to just 3.8%. If the US CPI figures at 1:30 p.m. UTC today are lower than expected, the bullish trend in GBP/USD might continue, potentially pushing the pair above 1.26600. However, higher-than-expected CPI figures may break the bullish trend in GBP/USD, bringing the pair below 1.26000."
Investing.com,CPI Preview,2024-02-13,0.666667,"Today marks the release of the most crucial event of the week  the US inflation data report.According to estimates from Investing.com's economic calendar, both the overall
Consumer Price Index
and the
core CPI
are expected to show a decline on an annual basis.At the monthly level, markets anticipate no significant change.Specifically, these are the expectations:The housing component, specifically the Shelter component, remains a significant question mark. It is a 'lagging' component that, as depicted in the image below, has been on a downward trend for some time.And since the Shelter component weighs about 33 percent of the total CPI, then we can well understand how important it is for the downward trend to continue to see steadily declining inflation.Given the recent front-run of the pivot by the housing and real estate markets, all eyes will be set on this specific part of the reading today.Investors must observe the treasury market as the main thermometer of general reaction to the numbers.That's because markets will be pricing in the
probability
of the Fed's first rate cut in light of today's numbers. Remember that the bond market is much bigger than the stock market and often the main driver of investor sentiment.If the inflation figure comes in lower than expected, the central bank might reconsider its stance on the first rate cut, potentially leading to further market gains.Hence, higher yields would imply that the market is still expecting a higher cost of capital for longer. Conversely, subsiding yields would imply that the Fed's pivot is ready to start.In case of good numbers (lowering inflation), interesting opportunities may arise in asset classes that have recently suffered, namely:Conversely, higher-than-expected CPI indicates that the Fed's job may still have room to run.

Investing.com,Will 2024 Be a Prosperous Year for China?,2024-01-08,0.333333,"After a period of strong gains and a close of the year near all-time highs, markets now seem to be facing a more tense climate with profit-taking on the world's major stock exchanges. Volatility has again become a major factor, with investors becoming more cautious and uncertain about possible interest rate cuts.
For our weekly appointment, we will focus on the most interesting stocks and futures contracts of the moment, as well as examine the general macroeconomic situation in the markets.
The stock of Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:
MRNA
) has been performing excellently in the stock market. During the last session, Oppenheimer increased his recommendation from ""market performance"" to ""outperformance."" According to the analyst responsible for the stock, there will be numerous catalysts in the next two years that will drive the lab's growth. Moderna is expected to have as many as five products on the market by 2026.It was a difficult week for shares of Mobileye Global (NASDAQ:
MBLY
) Inc MBLY Group. The stock fell 25 percent on a sales warning and a rating cut by Wolfe Research from ""Outperform"" to ""Peer Perform."" The company, known for its autonomous driving technologies, issued a sales alert due to excess inventory at its major customers. Mobileye expects first-quarter revenues to decline 50 percent from a year earlier and has revised downward its forecast for the fourth quarter 2023.
In the energy market, oil prices posted a modest 1 percent growth on the back of rising tensions in the Middle East. Despite this,
crude oil
prices remain under pressure after a difficult 2023 in which they fell 10 percent. According to the latest monthly report from the U.S. Energy Agency, oil inventories declined by 5.5 million barrels but refined product inventories rose sharply due to weak U.S. consumption.
The industrial metals market, including
copper
, begins the year in decline in 2024. Copper prices in London fell below $8,400 per metric ton due to the strengthening dollar. Nickel also declined, influenced by increased production in Indonesia. Meanwhile,
gold
fell due to rising bond yields and fairly strong U.S. employment data. I recently wrote an article analyzing the forecast for the gold market, expecting a decline in the coming months.The year 2023 was a year of recovery for stock markets, after a difficult period in 2022. Technology stocks rebounded strongly, while most financial markets in the West and Asia experienced a sustained recovery. The only exception was China, which struggled to rebound. In particular, the Hong Kong stock market recorded its fourth consecutive year of decline and was even outperformed by the Indian market in terms of capitalization. In 2024, we expect the Chinese revival to be a major theme to monitor, along with the start of the central banks' monetary easing cycle and the U.S. presidential election scheduled for November.
My focus is currently on the future Chinese

Investing.com,Fed Officials Refuse to Admit Theyre Done Hiking Rates.,2023-11-10,0.333333,"The Federal Reserve left its benchmark rate unchanged at a 22-year high at the conclusion of its meeting last week. But Fed chairman Jerome Powell is keeping up the fight against inflation, at least rhetorically.
Speaking Thursday before the International Monetary Fund, Powell suggested more tightening may ultimately be necessary to get inflation down to 2%.
Markets interpreted Powells remarks as hawkish in a shift from the dovish tone he conveyed in last weeks policy meeting. Hawkish or dovish, bullish or bearish, many investors are just fed up with the Fed moving markets on a daily basis.
CNBCs Brian Sullivan gave voice to some of those frustrations:
Brian Sullivan (CNBC): I don't want the market to be controlled by the Federal Reserve. I wish the Federal Reserve would just do their job in the background. Nobody could even name a Fed Chairman 30 years ago. Just do your stuff, be the grease in the wheels, the motor that nobody sees. We're living and dying on every Fed change of language.
Unfortunately, CNBC doesnt give voice to fundamental critiques of the fiat monetary system.
Central monetary planning that just operates behind the scenes and doesnt exert undue influence on markets is not a real solution to the problem.
For one thing, there will always be pressure from Washington and Wall Street for central bankers to intervene during times of financial crisis. It is unrealistic to expect policymakers to never abuse the tremendous power to create currency out of thin air.
For another, even if the Fed could somehow be made to operate strictly on a fixed set of rules that eliminated the subjectivity and guesswork from monetary decisions, it would still be distorting markets by artificially setting interest rates and inflation targets according to some arbitrary formula.
Its existing 2% inflation target, which it is still failing to reach, is nothing but a phony substitute for stable prices. According to prevailing economic orthodoxy, 0% inflation, or genuine price stability, would be bad for the economy because more people would save rather than spend.
And zero inflation would certainly be bad for major debtors such as the U.S. government because they could no longer expect the real value of what they owe to be eroded away over time.
Of course, the government wouldnt be in the hole for over $33 trillion in the first place if not for the fiat monetary system that fosters excessive borrowing. Under a gold standard, the governments spending capacity would be limited by the supply of bullion in reserves and the willingness of creditors to accept promises to deliver future quantities of money redeemable in gold.
A monetary system tethered to gold, silver, and possibly other hard assets as well would allow for true price discovery in interest rates and other markets while eliminating the need for commentators on CNBC to use their analytical skills to decipher the latest verbiage from central bankers.
But for now, markets will continue to key off the Feds every move, non-move, and head fake. The smart money in futures markets is still betting that the Feds next move will be to cut rates some time in 2024. But expectations are now shifting toward later rather than earlier in the year.
Amid the rate uncertainty, metals markets are struggling to break out into a year-end rally.
Gold prices pushed above the $2,000 level last week. But bulls failed to hold the line as selling pressure returned.
Bargain hunters may find platinum and palladium especially attractive at what appear to be deeply oversold levels. Like gold, platinum and palladium are available in the form of beautifully minted coins as well as affordable bullion bars.
Silver also looks tantalizingly cheap as it continues to be mired in a trading range.
Each of these three metals face supply deficits. Despite the risk of softening industrial demand in some sectors, new sources of demand are constantly emerging  especially in the areas of alternative energy and high-tech. And investment demand is a wild card that could be a catalyst for price gains in the white metals.
Investors havent seen fit to rush into bullion this year like have in years past. Of course, the Feds rate hikes have been a major headwind for metals markets.
But given the upward pressure they have put on the U.S. dollars foreign exchange rate, gold at least has held up quite well.
When the pressure finally reverses on the dollar to the downside, there could be plenty of upside realized across the metals space.***Mike Gleason is a Director with

Investing.com,How Patience and Delayed Gratification Can Fuel Long-Term Gains,2023-11-09,0.555556,"Have you ever heard of the Marshmallow Test?Initially designed for a juvenile audience, the test made its debut at Stanford University in the 1980s with a fundamental objective: gauging a child's ability to exercise self-control by delaying immediate gratification for a more significant reward in the future.The mechanics of the test were straightforwardchildren were presented with a choice: consume a single marshmallow immediately or wait for 15 minutes to receive two. Those opting for instant consumption could ring a bell before the 15-minute mark, forfeiting the second marshmallow.Remarkably, the outcomes over time revealed that children exhibiting patience and forgoing short-term gains in favor of delayed rewards tended to achieve better college results and develop higher self-esteem.Applying the Marshmallow Test to the financial markets, one wonders: how would investors fare in a similar scenario? Unfortunately, many investors resemble the child who opts for immediate consumption, sacrificing potential long-term benefits. This analogy prompts reflection on how frequently investors, lured by short-term gains, compromise the substantial returns offered by the stock market.Consider the instances where investors buy stocks, only to sell within 3-6 months, neglecting the merits of an 8-10 year investment horizon. Such behavior undermines individual performance relative to the market and hinders the capture of the full spectrum of opportunities presented by various asset classes.The ensuing illustration depicts the stark contrast between market offerings (depicted in red columns) and the average investor's returns over a 20-year period (depicted in gray).The rush of today's world has fueled our desire for instant gratification, mirroring those kids who can't resist devouring the marshmallow immediately, forsaking the promise of two later. As the market rollercoaster unfolds, investors, driven by a six-month horizon, are on edge, influenced by the current ebb and flow seen in 2022 and 2023.The pivotal query for investors: Can they resist the allure of short-term gains (or losses) to secure more substantial rewards in the long run?No academic scores here, but the contrast will be crystal clear over a decade or two. The patient and self-disciplined, akin to the second group of marshmallow testers, will watch their investments flourish, while the impulsive hunger of the first group will persist.***Disclaimer:

This trend is evident when examining US Treasuries as a benchmark, revealing an unprecedented bear market.The pertinent question arises: should this development truly have come as a surprise, considering the era of near-zero rates and yields that preceded it?History teaches us that sooner or later, excesses undergo correction; the challenge lies in predicting when precisely that correction will occur.The statistics, which correctly forecasted the first half of the year, as well as the 'usual' September correction period, now seem in favor of a positive year-end, as evidenced by the image below.Examining the dark blue columns, we can observe the monthly performance of the U.S. stock market in the last quarter of the year leading up to the election. Historically, it becomes evident that this performance tends to be positive, significantly outperforming the months of August and September, which consistently exhibit corrections.Furthermore, in years characterized by negative performance in August and September, historical data indicates that the fourth quarter has reported positive performance a remarkable 92.3% of the time (see image below).In a broader context, I recall that for an investor who has diligently executed their strategic planning and portfolio construction, it all ultimately boils down to a single critical market assessment. Yet, it's essential to emphasize that robust fundamentals and a well-defined time horizon consistently take precedence.See you next time!***Disclosure

Investing.com,The Only 2 Ways to Win in Trading,2023-09-19,0.666667,"It doesnt matter if you are Warren Buffett holding positions for decades or Ken Griffith holding them for milliseconds - there are only two ways to trade.In trading you can either go with the price action - or in traders parlance trade flow or go against the price action or fade the move.If you are going to day trade against trend need to know three things - what to trade, when to trade and how much profit to go for.Here is a set up I trade every day in stock index futures. During the European open (around 4 am) stock futures usually make a session high or session low that is fadable for at least 20 points. And even if the trade doesnt work the first time it usually resolves in profit on the second or the third attempt.But trend! Trend is something different altogether. Trend or flow trading has a very specific tell that can give very accurate reads on the market.Here is my proprietary bounce indicator in Flow mode. Notice anything? Flow trades which are bright green tiles on the chart tend to bunch together. Once a flow trade takes shape it tends to be followed by another.So what does that mean to us as retail traders?Simple. We only take a flow trade if the prior trade hit the take profit. If the prior trade was a loss we STOP TRADING until flow turn profitable again. Using this stop and go method we avoid the dreaded churn and increase our chance of winning trades tremendously.So here is the surprising takeaway for day trading. To trade counter trend you need to keep trying until you find the turn in the price action. But to trade trend you need stop and go stop and go until you sync yourself up with the trend move in the market.Thats pretty much the opposite of what most traders do - but now you know!"

Investing.com,The Fed Hasn't Done Enough to Beat Price Inflation,2024-02-15,0.555556,"By Mike Maharrey, Money Metals Exchange
Price inflation was supposed to be dead and buried months ago. But its doing just fine, thank you very much. The January Consumer Price Index report makes that pretty clear.
Sure, the Federal Reserve managed to knock inflation down. But it was never out. As a CNBC headline put it, Inflation just wont go away.
The fact of the matter is the central bank never did enough to make it go away.
And it probably never will.
In December, headline CPI went up from 3.1 to 3.4 percent. The mainstream financial pundits assured us it was a blip on the radar -- transitory if you will. The January data makes it harder to believe that narrative.
After Decembers surprise increase, annual CPI fell back to 3.1 percent in January, according to the latest BLS report. The fact that the annual number came down could be spun as good news, but considering the projection was for a steeper fall to 2.9 percent, its hard to crank up a celebration. And the decrease just brought annual price inflation down to its November level.
Its fair to argue that one or two months of data dont tell us a lot. So, what is the trend?
Hotter, not cooler.
If you annualize the CPI over the last three months, it comes to 4 percent, up from 3.3 percent.
The 6-month annualized CPI is 3.7 percent, up from 3.2 percent.
On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.3 percent, equaling the December gain. That was a steeper increase than the projected 0.2 percent.
Now consider this: prices have gone up over half a percent (0.6 percent) in just two months.
Things look even better for the inflation monster when we consider core CPI. This is supposed to be a better metric because it strips out more volatile food and energy prices.
In January, core CPI rose 0.4 percent, and it was up 3.9 percent on an annual basis. The monthly number was up from 0.3 percent last month, and the annual number was unchanged. The projection was for a 0.3 percent month-on-month gain with the annual number falling to 3.7 percent.
As was the case with the headline number, the trend in core CPI looks good for team inflation. It has been hovering in the 4 percent range since July. Thats double the mythical 2 percent target.
To put the monthly core CPI increase in perspective, it would need to average just under 0.17 percent per month to hit the 2 percent annual target.
The Fed claims to be data-dependent. Well, the data tells us that any talk of inflations demise was premature. No matter how you slice, dice, or massage the numbers, nothing indicates the Fed is anywhere near winning this fight.
And keep in mind, inflation is worse than the government data suggest. The government revised the CPI formula in the 1990s so that it understates the actual rise in prices. Based on the formula used in the 1970s, CPI is closer to double the official numbers. So, if the BLS was using the off formula, were looking at CPI closer to 6 percent.
And using an honest formula, it would probably be worse than that.
The much-anticipated CPI report is a disappointment for those who expected inflation to edge lower allowing the Fed to begin easing rates sooner rather than later, LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Krosby told CNBC.
Across the board numbers were hotter than expected making certain that the Fed will need more data before initiating a rate cutting cycle.
The markets made that disappointment clear. After all, theyre desperate for a fix of their easy-money drug. With price inflation alive and well, the Fed will likely delay the party. So, the markets threw a tantrum.
The stock markets sold off Tuesday. The
Dow
was down over 524 points. The S&P 500 slipped back below 5,000, shedding nearly 1.4 percent. And the
NASDAQ
fell 1.8 percent.
Meanwhile, bond yields  i.e. interest rates  rose and the
dollar
reached its almost two-month high above 104.70.
Gold
plummeted, testing the $2,000 per ounce support.
Of course, hope springs eternal. The stock market rallied on Wednesday, and the
S&P 500
reclaimed 5,000. A USB Wealth Management analyst told Bloomberg, The hot inflation data do not change our base case for a soft landing.
Despite the recent data, deep down, everybody still seems to believe the Fed has successfully beaten price inflation down.
Or maybe it's just wishful thinking. Regardless, the consensus still seems to be rate cuts are coming  if a few months later than hoped for. And to be fair, that's what the central bankers over at the Fed told us."

later recovered yet continued to trade below the critical 2,000 mark.Indeed, there was no sharp rebound above 2,000, as investors have essentially abandoned their expectations of the Fed's interest rate cut in March.However, the gold price may soon rebound as the US central bank doesn't view the latest inflation figures as problematic. Austan Goolsbee, the President of the Chicago Fed, stated on Wednesday that the Fed's plans to reach a 2% inflation target will remain on track, even if prices increase faster than expected over the next few months. In other words, the Fed believes that a single report can't alter its plans for normalising monetary policy in 2024.XAU/USD was essentially flat during the Asian and early European trading sessions.

Gold bulls are hoping for worse-than-expected figuresa drop in core retail sales or a significant rise in unemployment claims. Data indicating weakness in the US economy increases the chances of an interest rate cut, which may drive XAU/USD higher. Conversely, if the figures are stronger than expected, the bearish trend in gold may continue.The euro (EUR) gained 0.15% yesterday as the
US Dollar Index
(DXY) corrected slightly after a strong rally on Tuesday.EUR/USD
rose on Wednesday as bears consolidated gains following a major sell-off the day prior. Overall, EUR/USD remains in a clear bearish trend, as the divergence between eurozone and US monetary policies favours the greenback. Indeed, the bearish trend in EUR/USD has strengthened after a surprisingly strong US inflation report reduced the chance of an interest rate cut in March to almost zero and increased the uncertainty about the potential rate cut in May. Still, the bullish trend in DXY is already quite sustainable, and the key question is how long it can continue. The market changes its interest rate expectations rapidly, so traders should pay attention to any news that might impact these expectations. Strong economic growth, sticky inflation, and a tight labour market positively impact the currency. Meanwhile, sluggish economic performance, slowing inflation, and rising unemployment have the opposite effect.EUR/USD was weakening during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, the US will release macroeconomic reports that could impact investors' interest rate expectations, extending or pausing the bearish trend in EUR/USD.

Better-than-expected datastrong growth in retail sales, low unemployment claims or rising manufacturing indicesmay bring EUR/USD below 1.07000. Conversely, worse-than-expected figures may trigger a strong upward correction in EUR/USD, possibly pushing the pair above 1.07500.The Japanese yen (JPY) gained 0.16% on Wednesday after a strong US Dollar Index (DXY) rally prompted some traders to take profit on their long positions.Although the sell-off in
USD/JPY
accelerated in the Asian and early European trading sessions, the pair remains in a clear bullish trend. The recent Japan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data published earlier today further lowered the probability of an interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which should, in theory, exert upward pressure on USD/JPY. Official data showed that Japan's economy contracted by an annualised 0.4% in Q4 after a 3.3% slump in the previous quarter. In other words, Japan is now officially in a recession. Reuters reported that the country has lost its title as the world's third-biggest economy to Germany. The market now expects BOJ to hike its base rate by 25 basis points no earlier than in July, shifting from June. Technically, USD/JPY may correct to 149.500. However, the relative monetary policy between the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the BOJ favours the greenback.Today, USD/JPY traders will focus on several important macroeconomic reports that the US will release at 1:30 p.m. UTC. Retail Sales, Jobless Claims, and Manufacturing Indices from Philadelphia and New York could trigger above-normal volatility in all USD pairs. A short-term bearish trend in USD/JPY may accelerate if the figures are worse than expected and indicate weaknesses in the US economy. However, this bearish trend may break if the figuresespecially core retail salesare better than expected. The short-term technical bias remains bearish as the Japanese yen trades below the important intraday level of 150.200."

It was just two days ago, it was supposed to be important, and potentially trend-changing. Interestingly, the kneejerk market reaction remained short-lived. The fact that inflation in other places, like in the UK, didnt pick up certainly helped cementing the idea that, this is certainly just a blip in the disinflation trend, and if its not, the Chicago Federal Reserves (Fed) Goolsbee said that slightly higher inflation data for a few months will still be consistent with a further easing toward the Feds 2% target. Staff at the European Central Bank (ECB) sounded more poetic, posting the worlds cheesiest central bank message Roses are red, violets are blue, were nearing our target, and we will reach too. So, its in this atmosphere of love and hope that investors got their thoughts together and put on their dip-buyer heads, went out there, and chased good deals  if you can call them good at the current levels.And know that even The Big Shorts Michael Burry  who is famous for shorting stocks and who was short the chip stocks last year, short the

2-year

10-year
yields retraced the post-CPI jump on markets ignorance of the inflation risks that should delay the first rate cut from the Fed. The
US dollar
gave back field. But note that, despite the bulls keeping their faces on, the expectation of Fed rate cuts is not what it used to be at the start of the year. Investors will focus on retail sales, and some manufacturing indices today to continue guessing when the Fed will move. Stronger retail sales should weaken the Fed doves, while soft manufacturing should support them. The market pricing suggests 3 fully priced rate cuts, and a fourth cut priced at around 70%. Thats less than the 4 rate cuts priced for the ECB.As such, the euros depreciation against the US dollar remains well supported by fundamentals. There is one thing, though. The dovish ECB expectations are fueled by soft growth and falling inflation in the euro area. But a broadly stronger US dollar is inflationary for the rest of the world because everything from commodities to oil are negotiated in USD terms. Therefore, the hawkish shift from the Fed and a stronger US dollar could lead to an undesired U-turn in European inflation, soften the ECB doves hand and throw a floor under the
EUR/USD
selloff.Happily, energy prices are not yet threatening enough. In this context, the barrel of
US crude
fell sharply, after trading above the 200-DMA, as the latest EIA data printed an 8.5-mio barrel increase in oil inventories last week.
Nat gas futures
continue to dive as well, driven by soft demand due to record high production, ample supplies, and mild winter both in Europe and the US.Elsewhere, data released this morning in Japan showed that the country unexpectedly entered recession in Q4. The economy shrank 0.1%, while analysts were expecting a 0.3% expansion. The private consumption declined for the 3rd straight quarter. If the latter didnt trigger a fresh selloff in the Japanese yen due to the heavy threat of direct intervention."
Investing.com,Fed Bank Bailout Program Ends in March...Then What?,2024-02-16,0.666667,"By Mike Maharrey, Money Metals Exchange
The bank bailout program established by the Federal Reserve in the wake of last spring's banking crisis is scheduled to shut down on March 11.
Then what?
There are a lot more questions than answers.
For instance, will the Fed blink?
And if it doesnt, how will the end of the bailout ripple through the financial system?
The Federal Reserve created the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank (OTC:
SBNY
) last March, allowing banks to easily access cash to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors.""
As one would expect, the balance in the program surged initially as banks tapped into the bailout. But borrowing never stopped. As you can see from the chart, borrowing leveled off in August before the sudden spike in November. Keep in mind that banks were still tapping into the bailout even as the total balance in the program plateaued. Some banks were paying off loans as others borrowed.The BTFP was a sweetheart deal for cash-strapped banks struggling to cope with crashing bond portfolios as interest rates rose.
Through this lending facility, banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions can take out short-term loans (up to one year) using U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral.
Thats where the sweetheart deal comes in. Instead of valuing these collateral assets at their market value, banks can borrow against them at par (Face value).
When the Fed started raising interest rates, bond prices dropped precipitously (Bond yields and bond prices are inversely correlated.) As bond prices fell, the value of bank asset portfolios crashed along with them. Typically, the amount banks can borrow is based on the current market value of their bond portfolios. As bonds tanked their borrowing ability shrank. But by valuing collateral at par, the Fed allowed banks to borrow as if the value of the assets never dropped. Simply put, the BTFP allows banks to borrow more than they otherwise could.
Imagine if there was a tornado in your area that damaged your house. The home would suddenly be worth a lot less than it was before the storm, right? Now imagine going to the bank and asking for a second mortgage based on the value of your home before the tornado. Do you think that bank would make that loan?
Of course not.
The bank probably wouldnt loan you money based on the lower value of your storm-damaged house, much less on what your home was worth before the tornado. Banks simply dont accept collateral that is worth less than the amount of the loan.
That is unless youre a bank in trouble.
The problems at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) that led to its demise reveal the reason for the bailout.
SVB went under because it tried to sell undervalued bonds to raise cash. The plan was to sell the longer-term, lower-interest-rate bonds and reinvest the money into shorter-duration bonds with a higher yield. Instead, the sale dented the banks balance sheet with a $1.8 billion loss driving worried depositors to pull funds out of the bank.
The BTFP gave banks an alternative. They could quickly raise capital against their bond portfolios without realizing big losses in an outright sale. It gives banks a way out, or at least the opportunity to kick the can down the road for a year.
In effect, the bailout papered over significant problems in the banking system.That remains unclear what will happen when the BTFP locks its doors on March 11.
In the first week of the BTFP, banks borrowed $11.9 billion from the program, along with more than $300 billion from the already-established Fed Discount Window. By April 5, the balance in the BTFP rose to just over $79 billion. By June, banks had borrowed around $100 billion. Borrowing plateaued before taking off again in November.
Troubled banks almost certainly accounted for the bulk of the borrowing in the early months of the bailout. Those early loans will start coming due in March. (Banks had one year from the loan date to repay.)
There are several unanswered questions. Have these banks improved their financial position since getting bailed out? Do they have the cash to pay back the loans? Will the end of the BTFP force them to liquidate their devalued bonds like SVB did?
If banks didnt address their underlying problems over the last year, we may well see more small and regional banks go under in the coming months.
And If that happens, will the Fed blink and reopen the BTFP?
This is something to keep our eyes on."
Investing.com,Why Rising Shipping Costs Won't Cause Inflation,2024-02-16,0.333333,"By Mike Maharrey, Money Metals Exchange
Defining inflation as ""rising prices"" creates all kinds of confusion.
As I explained in-depth, historically, inflation meant an increase in the amount of money and credit in the economy, or more succinctly, an expansion in the money supply. Rising consumer prices - price inflation - is one symptom of this monetary inflation.
By redefining inflation as rising prices government people can muddy the water and shift the blame.
I found the perfect example of this in a recent email from Seeking Alpha. It highlighted shipping disruptions in the Middle East and speculated that rising shipping costs could be ""inflationary.""
In effect, they are speculating that rising prices might cause rising prices.
It's fair to worry that higher shipping costs could be passed on to consumers, causing prices of many things to rise. But even if higher shipping costs eventually do get passed along to consumers, that isn't ""inflation"" in the true sense of the word.
An increase in the money supply - inflation - causes all prices to rise more than they otherwise would. Price shocks such as higher shipping rates can certainly reverberate broadly through the economy causing a lot of prices to go up. But they won't cause all prices to rise. Some will actually fall.
Tom Woods did a good job of explaining the impact of price shocks in contrast to inflationary price increases in his email newsletter. He uses rising energy prices as an example, but the same would apply to elevated shipping costs.
Some sectors of the economy can see their prices rise because of changes in taste, or sudden disruptions (caused by war, natural disaster, etc.), or other such factors.
But the only explanation (barring a sudden fall in money demand, which would itself require an explanation) for rising prices across the board is an increase in the amount of money in the system.
And this is why some of the MAGA people are also getting it wrong. Rising energy prices cannot cause price inflation across the board. Rising energy prices leave less money to spend on other things, so prices are a wash. Only more money overall can raise prices everywhere.
The regime would like you to think that you are suffering because of every reason in the world EXCEPT the central bank it created and endowed with a monopoly. It's evil companies, it's 'greed,' it's 'cost-push,' whatever. It's all b.s.
As Woods points out, the political class wants you to believe higher shipping costs, or rising oil prices, or greedy corporations, or ""Putin's price hikes,"" or perhaps Vodoo is causing price inflation. That lets them off the hook.
Economist Ludwig von Mises summed it up this way.
The result of this deplorable confusion is that there is no term left to signify the cause of this rise in prices and wages. There is no longer any word available to signify the phenomenon that has been, up to now, called inflation As you cannot talk about something that has no name, you cannot fight it.
Of course, the government and the central bankers at the Fed don't really want to fight inflation. They want inflation. Increasing the money supply allows politicians to continue borrowing and spending. They just don't want you to notice the inflation they are creating as a matter of policy. If they can convince you it's because of shipping costs, all the better.
Don't be fooled."

Such is particularly the case when you read commentary about the state of the average American as follows.Even M.B.A.s are finding it difficult.These stories are not unique. If you Google

you will get many article links. The question, of course, is why individuals with college degrees, no less, are having such a tough time finding employment. After all, aside from record-smashing employment reports, we also continue to see near-record low jobless claims and high numbers of job openings, as shown below.The Washington Post touched on part of the problem and why the unemployment rate for college graduates is higher than for all workers.As the Washington Post summed up:Of course, it isnt just the shuttering of the economy and the shift to working from home causing the problem. It is also the shift in demand from consumers to more service-oriented conveniences, combined with the need by employers to maintain profitability.Since the turn of the century, the U.S. economy has shifted from a manufacturing-based economy to a service-oriented one. There are two primary reasons for this.The first is that the
cost of labor
in the U.S. to manufacture goods is too high. Domestic workers want high wages, benefits, paid vacations, personal time off, etc. On top of that are the numerous regulations on businesses from OSHA to Sarbanes-Oxley, FDA, EPA, and many others. All those additional costs are a factor in producing goods or services. Therefore, corporations needed to offshore production to countries with lower labor costs and higher production rates to manufacture goods competitively.During an interview with

: Because, you know, immigrants come in, and
they tend to work at a rate that is at or above that for non-immigrants
.
Immigrants who come to the country tend to be in the workforce at a slightly higher level than native Americans.
But thats primarily because of the age difference. They tend to skew younger.
The suppression of wages, increased productivity to reduce the amount of required labor, and offshoring has been a multi-decade process to increase corporate profitability.Following the pandemic-related shutdown, corporations faced multiple threats to profitability from supply constraints, a shift to increased services, and a lack of labor. At the same time, mass immigration
(both legal and illegal)
provided a workforce willing to fill lower-wage paying jobs and work regardless of the shutdown.
Since 2019, the cumulative employment change has favored foreign-born workers, who have gained almost 2.5 million jobs, while native-born workers have lost 1.3 million.
Unsurprisingly, foreign-born workers also lost far fewer jobs during the pandemic shutdown.Given that the bulk of employment continues to be in lower-wage paying service jobs
(i.e., restaurants, retail, leisure, and hospitality)
such is why part-time jobs have dominated full-time in recent reports.
Relative to the working-age population, full-time employment has dropped sharply after failing to recover pre-pandemic levels.However, as noted, full-time employment has declined since 2000 as services dominate labor-intensive processes such as manufacturing. This is because we
export
 our
inflation
and import
deflation.
We do this to buy flat-screen televisions for $299 versus $3,999. Such is also why the economy continues to grow slower, requiring ever-increasing debt levels.For recent college graduates, this all leads to a more dire outlook.To keep an economy growing, you must have population growth. In other words,
demographics are destiny.
As such, there are two ways to obtain more robust population growth rates  natural births and immigration. As shown below, the fertility rate in the United States is problematic in that we arent producing enough children to replace an aging workforce.Such is particularly problematic given the rapid aging of older adults versus a declining working-age population. Such means the underfunding of entitlements will continue to grow, requiring more debt issuance to fill the gap.However, there is a vast difference between immigration policies that import highly skilled workers, capital, and education versus those that dont. Merit-based immigration policies bring workers who earn higher salaries, create businesses, employ labor, and create tax revenues and other economic contributions. However, current policies are creating a rush of lower-skilled, uneducated labor that will work for cheaper wages, produce less revenue, and are subsidized by tax-payers through welfare programs. As noted above, these workers tend to fill the jobs in the service areas of the economy, thereby displacing native-born workers. Such was a point made by the
WSJ:Post-pandemic, this has not been the case, which is impacting native-born employment. This is not a new issue, but one addressed by Bill Clinton in the 1995 State of the Union Address:Such is the natural consequence of a change in the economys demands and the need for corporations to maintain profitability in an ultimately deflationary environment.While there is much debate over immigration, most of the arguments do not differentiate between legal and illegal immigration. There are certainly arguments that can be made on both sides. However, what is less debatable is the impact that immigration is having on employment. Of course, as native-born workers continue to demand higher wages, benefits, and other tax-funded support, those costs must be passed on by the companies creating those products and services. At the same time, consumers are demanding lower prices.That imbalance between input costs and selling price drives companies to aggressively seek options to reduce the highest cost to any business  labor.Such is why full-time employment has declined since 2000 despite the surge in the Internet economy, robotics, and artificial intelligence. It is also why wage growth fails to grow fast enough to sustain the cost of living for the average American. These technological developments increased employee productivity, reducing the need for additional labor.Unfortunately, these tales of college graduates expecting high-paying jobs will likely continue to find it increasingly complicated. Particularly as
Artificial Intelligence
becomes cheap enough to displace higher-paid employees."
Investing.com,4 Must-Know Investing Insights From an Interview With Howard Marks,2024-02-16,0.666667,"Yesterday marked a memorable day for me as I never envisioned having the opportunity to engage in a conversation with one of the greatest investors in history and gather insights on the market.During yesterday afternoon, I had the chance to exchange ideas and opinions with
Howard Marks
, co-founder, and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management. We discussed many topics, such as his new book, current market conditions, and investing philosophy.According to Howard:You can watch the full interview here:Below are my top four takeaways from this incredible chat.When considering the most crucial advice for investors, it boils down to a simple mantra: adopt a buy-and-hold strategy for the long term.This approach emphasizes the importance of discipline, rational decision-making, and the ability to detach from emotions, paving the way for sustained success in the market.In 100 years of history, the
S&P 500
index has achieved an average annual performance of around 10%, and for 99% of investors, that is sufficient.'Time in the market' is a lot better than 'timing the market.' It makes no sense to try to pick the highs and lows and move continuously.Marks went on to quote Charlie Munger: Market timing demands not just one decision, but two: one for deciding when to exit the markets and another for determining when to re-enter. Often, both decisions turn out to be wrong.Investing because we are attached to a particular car or work for a specific company leads nowhere. We must be objective, look at the numbers and the business, and not make choices based on emotions.People often tend to act counter to what is advisable. They tend to buy at market highs, driven by euphoria and optimism, only to sell at lows, overwhelmed by despair.Howard Marks has successfully executed his best operations by acquiring assets during periods of extreme pessimism. He cites instances such as the collapse of emerging markets in the 1990s and the subprime crisis.Contrary to prevailing trends, making decisions based on fundamentals and objective data often results in numerous satisfactions.***Institutions and billionaire investors worldwide are already well ahead of the game when it comes to AI-powered investing, extensively using, customizing, and developing it to bulk up their returns and minimize losses.Now, InvestingPro users can do just the same from the comfort of their own homes with our new flagship AI-powered stock-picking tool: ProPicks.With our six strategies, including the flagship ""Tech Titans,"" which outperformed the market by a lofty 1,183% over the last decade, investors have the best selection of stocks in the market at the tip of their fingers every month.Subscribe here and never miss a bull market again

Investing.com,Building an Investment Portfolio,2024-02-16,0.555556,"Remember when the GameStop (NYSE:
GME
) frenzy caught Wall Street by surprise?It showed us that the stock market could sometimes play by unexpected rules. It's a clear sign that just sticking to the usual stocks and bonds might not be enough anymore.That's why it's time to think outside the traditional box and get to know unconventional assets and strategies.Conventional investments are familiar  think shares in big companies, government bonds, or your typical savings accounts. They're the foundation of most investment portfolios.However, unconventional assets, like cryptocurrencies or peer-to-peer lending, are the new kids on the block, adding a new layer of protection and potential growth to your portfolio.Building a robust investment portfolio today means mixing the old with the new  pairing traditional investments with modern ones to stay ahead. Ready to build an investment portfolio that's fit for the future? Lets dive in.Before jumping into the exciting world of unconventional investing, it's important to lay a strong foundation. Today's market isn't just about picking winners; it's about understanding your own financial landscape and how different assets fit into it.Heres how to get started:In an ever-evolving marketplace, unconventional assets have become more than just buzzwords  they are the new frontier for investors looking to broaden their horizons.These aren't your typical stocks and bonds or stock diversifications; unconventional assets include anything from digital currencies changing the face of money to art pieces that hold historical value.They are the assets that challenge traditional market behaviors, often moving independently of the stock market's ebb and flow, offering a fresh avenue for growth and diversification. Below, we explore some of the top unconventional assets and how they fit into your investment portfolio:Cryptocurrencies have evolved from a novel digital experiment into a diverse and significant asset class, capturing the interest of both individual and institutional investors.Influential celebrity tweets and important regulatory updates have influenced cryptos prominence and appeal, shaping public perception and acceptance.For the modern investor looking to expand their portfolio, cryptocurrencies provide growth potential and a hedge against traditional market downturns. Here's a guide to getting started with this unconventional asset class:Real estate investment trusts are an avenue to invest in real estate without the hassle of buying property directly. REITs are companies that own, operate, or finance income-generating real estate, such as retail, residential, healthcare, corporate, industrial, hospitality, and specialty properties.By investing in shares of a REIT, you get a slice of the income produced from these diverse property types without the need to directly buy, manage, or finance any properties yourself. REITs often pay out a good chunk of their earnings as dividends to shareholders, making them attractive for those seeking regular income.Additionally, one of the key advantages of REITs in a portfolio is their potential to offer diversification. Unlike conventional assets, the performance of REITs is often not directly tied to stock market movements.This means that even when the broader stock market is experiencing a downturn, some REITs, particularly those in recession-resistant sectors, might still maintain stable performance or even see growth.Recent market trends have indicated positive performance for REITs that focus on industrial properties like warehouses and distribution centers. Most notably, this shift is the result of rising e-commerce and online shopping demand.For newcomers, start with publicly traded REITs that can be bought and sold through brokerage accounts like Vanguard, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab (NYSE:
SCHW
). When choosing a REIT, be informed about overall market dynamics, property types, performance history, dividend yields, and the quality of management.Platforms such as Yahoo Finance or the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) are invaluable for gaining insights into various REITs helping investors make informed decisions.Precious metals, particularly gold and silver, have long held a unique position in the investment world, especially as unconventional assets. Their appeal has grown in recent years, as they're often seen as a safe haven during economic upheavals, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.When traditional financial markets are unstable, investors frequently turn to these metals, valuing them for their tangible nature and historical resilience against inflation and currency devaluation. In fact, between March and August 2020, the price for an ounce of gold shot up 70[1] %.During times of economic uncertainty, precious metals like gold and silver tend to retain or increase in value. This phenomenon is partly due to their limited supply and enduring demand, as well as their status as an alternative to fiat currency, which can be subject to inflation and devaluation.There are several ways to include precious metals in your investment portfolio:Additionally, platforms like Kitco provide real-time data on metal prices, news, and market analysis, while the World Gold Council offers extensive resources on market trends and investment strategies for precious metals.Unlike traditional assets like stocks or bonds, investing in art and collectibles involves acquiring tangible items with intrinsic cultural, historical, or artistic value. This unconventional asset class has gained attention for its potential to appreciate value while offering an opportunity to merge personal interests with financial goals.The world of collectibles and art is vast, ranging from classic pieces like paintings and sculptures to modern collectibles such as vintage comic books, rare stamps, limited edition sneakers, and even digital art in the form of
non-fungible tokens
(NFTs).Recently, the art market has seen a shift with the advent of online auctions and digital platforms. Websites like Artsy and Saatchi Art have made art more accessible, allowing investors to explore and purchase art from around the globe.The rise of NFTs has also introduced a digital dimension to art collecting, with platforms like OpenSea and Rarible leading the charge in this new market.The value of collectibles often lies in their rarity, condition, historical significance, and demand among collectors. For instance, rare coins, vintage watches, and classic cars have communities of enthusiasts and collectors, which can drive up their value over time.Auction houses like Sotheby's and Christies and specialized websites like Heritage Auctions provide venues for purchasing such items.Authenticity, provenance, and condition are key factors in valuing art and collectibles. Consulting experts, using authentication services, and researching through databases like Artprice or the Certified Collectibles Group can provide insights.Typically, art and collectibles are considered long-term investments. Appreciation can take time, and the market can fluctuate. Patience and a passion for the items you invest in can make this journey rewarding.Beyond exploring unconventional assets, modern investors also have access to a range of innovative investment strategies that can further strengthen and diversify their portfolios.These strategies, often leveraging new technologies and financial products, offer fresh perspectives and approaches to asset management.The following are some of the top unconventional investment strategies that can help build a robust portfolio:Dollar-Cost-Averaging involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. By investing consistently over time, you avoid the pitfalls of trying to time the market  a challenging feat even for seasoned investors.For example, if you decide to invest $100 monthly into crypto, you will purchase more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high. Over time, this can result in a lower average cost per share, potentially reducing the impact of market fluctuations on your investment.This strategy is well-suited for turbulent markets, like those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, where frequent swings in asset prices made it difficult to determine the best time to invest. It offers a methodical approach, easing the stress of making large, lump-sum investments at possibly inopportune times.Tools like investment calculators, available on financial websites such as Investopedia or Morningstar, can help you visualize the potential outcomes of a DCA strategy with various investment amounts and time frames.Many investment platforms and robo-advisors also offer automated DCA options, allowing you to set up regular investments without having to manually execute each transaction.Peer-to-peer lending allows individuals to loan money directly to other individuals or businesses through online platforms, bypassing traditional financial institutions like banks. P2P lending offers the potential for higher returns compared to traditional savings or fixed-income investments, aligning with the current trend of digital finance and fintech innovation.At its core, P2P lending works by connecting investors with borrowers through platforms like Lending Club, Prosper, and Funding Circle. As an investor, you fund a portion of a loan and, in return, receive monthly repayments with interest.This setup diversifies your investment across multiple loans, spreading the risk. For example, instead of lending a large sum to a single borrower, you can distribute your investment across several loans with varying interest rates and maturity terms.To mitigate risks, most platforms grade borrowers based on creditworthiness, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance. Tools like automated investment options and secondary markets for selling loans can also help manage and liquidate your investments if needed.Robo-advisors are automated platforms that use algorithms to manage investment portfolios, making them an excellent option for both novice and experienced investors who seek a hands-off approach to managing their finances.Robo-advisors use algorithms to analyze your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline and then automatically allocate your assets across a diversified portfolio.Platforms like Betterment, Wealthfront, and Vanguard's Digital Advisor offer easy entry points into the world of investing, with lower fees and minimum balances compared to traditional investment advisors. They provide an efficient way to build and maintain a diversified portfolio, regularly rebalancing to align with market changes and your evolving financial goals.In the current financial climate, marked by rapid technological advancements and shifting market trends, robo-advisors cater to a growing desire for investment strategies that are both data-driven and user-friendly. Their algorithms are designed to adapt to market fluctuations, making them particularly relevant in volatile or uncertain market conditions.Thematic investing is like putting a spotlight on the future, focusing your investments on big ideas and trends that are shaping the world. Instead of just picking stocks or sectors based on their current performance, this strategy dives into areas that are expected to grow and transform industries over time.A core aspect of thematic investing is its focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market fluctuations. For instance, current themes gaining traction include sustainable energy, technological advancements like artificial intelligence and 5G, and evolving consumer habits driven by digital transformation.Investing in these themes means identifying companies and funds that are expected to benefit from these long-term, global shifts.Tools and platforms that facilitate thematic investing include ETFs and mutual funds focused on specific themes. For example, the ARK Innovation ETF allows investors to tap into innovative tech companies. Additionally, investment platforms like M1 Finance and Motif Investing offer the ability to create custom portfolios centered around specific themes.Sustainable investing is an approach that combines investors' desire to generate financial returns with their interest in creating a positive social or environmental impact.This strategy, often synonymous with socially responsible investing (SRI) or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, has gained significant traction in the current market, driven by a growing awareness of global issues like climate change, social inequality, and corporate governance.At its core, sustainable investing involves selecting investments based on their ethical and sustainability criteria, along with their financial prospects.This could mean investing in companies that actively reduce their environmental footprint, engage in social responsibility, or exhibit strong governance and ethical business practices. The idea is to support businesses that contribute positively to the world while also seeking financial gains.For example, the rise of green energy and the shift towards sustainable practices across industries have made ESG-focused funds and companies increasingly popular. Investment tools and platforms have responded to this trend by offering more ESG-focused options.For instance, mutual funds and ETFs like the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF provide exposure to companies with high ESG ratings, while platforms like Betterment offer socially responsible portfolio options.Investors looking to engage in sustainable investing can start by:In a financial world that's rapidly evolving, staying ahead means embracing both unconventional assets and innovative investment strategies. A blend of traditional wisdom and modern insight can lead to a robust and resilient investment portfolio tailored not just for today's market but for the future landscape of investing."
Investing.com,"Gold Rebounds Above 2,000; Euro Higher on Weaker-Than-Expected Retail Sales Data",2024-02-16,0.666667,"The gold (XAU) price rose towards 2,008 yesterday, rebounding from a short-lived drop. Currently, the price remains above 2,000.Yesterday's US retail sales figures indeed surprised the market. Investors and experts had expected the Retail Sales Index for January to stand at 0.2%, while the data showed a decrease of 0.6%. The significant difference between the actual and expected numbers affected the
US dollar
exchange rate and pushed
XAU/USD
higher.The main driver for the gold price in the short term is interest rate expectations. XAU/USD may remain under bearish pressure in the short term until the Fed announces the exact timing of rate cuts, noted Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank. In other words, gold traders are awaiting any new data from the Fed, and the current XAU/USD fluctuations are just preparation for changes in US monetary policy. However, a single report is unlikely to change investors' interest rate expectations significantly. Thus, market participants pay attention to all US macroeconomic data.XAU/USD started the Asian session moving sideways. Later today, increased volatility may be caused by several important US reports. The market is waiting for data on the Producer Price Index (PPI) at 1:30 p.m. UTC. Analysts expect the PPI figures for January to be below the projected 0.1%, which could push XAU/USD higher. Conversely, numbers higher than forecast may pull the pair towards 1,980.Worse-Than-Expected Retail Sales Data Pushed the Euro HigherThe euro (EUR) gained 0.59% on Thursday after the US Retail Sales report came out weaker than expected and pulled the US dollar and Treasury yields lower.EUR/USD
rose above the important 1.07500 level yesterday after official data showed that US retail sales fell more than expected in January. However, investors' interest rate expectations didn't change much as other macroeconomic dataspecifically, Jobless Claims figureswere better than expected. The market still doesn't expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to deliver a rate cut this spring. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability that the US central bank will ease its monetary policy in May currently stands at just 38%.Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to make dovish remarks. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the head of the Bank of France and the ECB member, said on Friday that the regulator 'shouldn't hold off the first rate cut for too long.' Indeed, the eurozone's economy continues to struggle, so interest rate cuts may be warranted soon. On Tuesday, an official report revealed that Germany's ZEW Current Economic Conditions Index declined more than expected in February, while the eurozone's Gross Domestic Product figures for Q1 grew by a mere 0.1% in Q4.EUR/USD was falling during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, 2 releases will likely trigger additional volatility in all USD pairs and possibly provoke sharp moves in EUR/USD: the US Producer Price Index at 1:30 p.m. UTC and Consumer Sentiment reports at 3:00 p.m. UTC. Higher-than-expected figures should exert bearish pressure on the pair, while lower-than-expected results may encourage EUR/USD bulls. Currently, the short-term technical bias remains bullish as the pair is moving above the pivotal 1.07500 level.The Canadian dollar (CAD) gained 0.58% on Thursday as the US retreated following the weaker-than-expected US Retail Sales report.USD/CAD
has been trading in a bullish trend since December 2024, and this trend is now at risk of breaking as the pair tests the critical support level near 1.34500. The recent rise in
crude oil
prices and strong Canadian employment figures have substantially boosted the Canadian dollar. Fundamentally, investors' interest rate expectations also favor CAD over USD. According to interest rate swap market data, the market currently prices in just 70 basis points (bps) worth of rate cuts by the Bank of Canada (BOC) and more than 90 bps of rate reductions by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2024. However, some speculate that the BOC may soon end its quantitative tightening program and increase liquidity in financial markets. In theory, this could exert upward pressure on USD/CAD.USD/CAD was rising slightly during the Asian and early European trading sessions. Today, traders should focus on 2 US reports: the Producer Price Index at 1:30 p.m. UTC and Consumer Sentiment at 3:00 p.m. UTC. Higher-than-expected figures should boost USD/CAD, while lower-than-expected results should have the opposite effect. Currently, the short-term technical bias remains bearish as USD/CAD is trading below the pivotal 1.35100 level."
Investing.com,Blinded by the Brilliance at the Tunnels End,2024-02-16,0.666667,"The
S&P 500
rebounded past the 5000 yesterday. This time, a mixed set of manufacturing data and a drop in US retail sales  which fell the most in almost a year  were brought forward as soothing factors regarding the dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. But if retail sales had remained strong, investors wouldve been as happy to see the US economy land soft.We are coming to a point where the economic data becomes meaningless. Whatever the data prints, the US stock markets find a positive narrative to keep the rally going. Its, of course, blind optimism; investors are blinded by the brilliance of the rate cuts at the tunnels end.Today, the US will reveal the latest producer price update. The producer price inflation is expected to have slowed in January. And if it didnt, it doesnt matter.This week only, we learned that two of the G7 economies entered recession: Japan and the UK. Japan lost its spot of the worlds 3rd biggest economy to Germany, while Germany is in the process of losing its status as the European growth engine. GDP growth per head in the UK hints that the recession started two years ago. Growth in the euro area remains anemic, on the other hand, as the Eurozone economies struggle with rising interest rates.But when you look at the stock markets, the
Stoxx 50
index traded at an ATH even though the fourth quarter earnings miss in the region havent been this bad for at least 4 years, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the Japanese
Nikkei
index is closing in on a record high as well  the index is now at a spitting distance from the highest levels since the 1990s despite entering a recession in the second half of last year. Negative rates and the ultra-cheap yen keep stock prices running up a mountain.But the global stock markets are not breathing on their own at this altitude. If the central banks pull out the oxygen support, parts of the market should come down tumbling.The
US Dollar Index
retreated to 100-DMA and sees support at this level. The
EUR/USD
tested its own 100-DMA resistance to the upside and sees resistance at this level. The
USD/JPY
bulls sit timidly above the 150 level, knowing that this is probably a peak, or close to a peak before the Japanese do something to reverse the selloff. And Cable makes repeated attempts below its 200-DMA and needs the dollar bulls to make a decisive move to the upside to continue its journey to the 1.25 level.
Gold
is back above the $2000 per ounce, but the positive pressure in the US yields will likely weigh on the yellow metal appetite and prevent the gold diggers from aiming for new highs as the Fed doves retreat, and
Bitcoin
is doing just fine. Nine Bitcoin ETFs that have been trading since early January have already amassed $10bn of inflows. And its just the beginning.Elsewhere,
oil
bulls and bears are fighting near the 200-DMA. Trend and momentum indicators are in favor of a further push toward the $80pb. OPECs monthly report showed this week that not all OPEC members are delivering the promised production cuts. In a separate report, the IEA said that the global oil market may be in surplus this year because supplies outside OPEC are expected to increase by 1.6mbpd; the US, Brazil, Canada, and Guyana are pumping to fill in OPECs production gap. On the demand side, the IEA sees global oil consumption rising only 1.2mbpd this year, half slower than last years increase. The bulls need China to stand up and walk. Otherwise, the road will be bumpier above the 200-DMA."
